question,answer
Who maintains the data in VERSO?,The data is maintained by librarians and staff at the University of Idaho Library. 
What is the source for profile information?,"Profile data are compiled from the University of Idaho website and Banner.. Publications come from Clarivate’s Central Discovery Index, which in turn, gathers from sources such as Web of Science, Pubmed, Crossref and other databases, and from individual CVs, used with consent of the faculty. Grant data comes from individual submissions. We do not currently use UI’s internal grant system, Veras, for data, although we hope to add that connection in the future. "
How do I edit my profile?,"You can edit your profile by signing into VERSO (using your Vandal NetID and password)  and clicking the Edit Profile button that appears above your profile picture when you're signed in.

Select the 'Researcher Proxies' option from the menu on the left. You can make anyone in the system a proxy by clicking 'add proxy' and adding their email to the form."
How often is VERSO updated?,"Weekly, depending on the data available. New faculty and researchers are added annually or on request, and our overall list of personnel is checked irregularly. "
How do you deal with privacy?,"We only collect professional data related to research, scholarship, and faculty status at the University of Idaho. Contact information and images are obtained from the University of Idaho website. Academic citation data is provided through faculty consent, often sought through department chairs/deans. Third-party authors who may be listed are only present due to their co-authorship or co-grantsmanship with University of Idaho faculty. Student data is not deliberately included unless a specific written request by the student is made.  <br><br>We take individual privacy seriously. Any request to be removed from the public portal will be granted; contact Jeremy Kenyon to do so. However, your scholarship data will still be in the system for use in university research analytics; request for removal must be submitted in writing to the Dean of Libraries. "
