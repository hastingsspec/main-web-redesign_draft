"Do I have to pay to use the MILL?","The MILL offers its services at no cost to the public. However, for large projects we may ask you to bring in your own preapproved materials (such as filament for 3D printing)."
"Where is the MILL?","When entering through the main doors of the library, walk straight towards the back. The MILL is located in the left corner."
"How long does it take to use a 3D printer?","3D printing is typically an hours-long process, depending on the size and complexity of the project. Many people pick their projects up the next day."
"Do I have to know how to use the machines?","Not at all! The MILL encourages learning and new experiences. Those who are looking to gain some insight are welcome to come and speak with us. We will walk you through the processes!"
"What is a makerspace?","A makerspace is a place where people with shared interests come together to work on projects using unique technology."
"How far in advance do I need to reserve a 3D printer?","Reservations need to be made at least 72 hours in advance. Reservations can be made through the MILL homepage."
"Do I need to bring in my own design?","Designs for the 3D printers or vinyl cutter can easily be found online, so it is absolutely fine if you are not quite sure about the design you want. Come into the MILL and we will help you find the right match! If you do have your design and you would like to discuss it before printing, feel free to drop in before your reservation."
