Research,"What is a ""finding aid?""","A finding aid is a detailed description and inventory of an archival collection. Similar to a Table of Contents or Index in a book, an archival finding aid is meant to tell you what is inside a given box or folder of an archival collection, so you can find what you're looking for more quickly.

A finding aid also provides information about the types of materials in a collection (for example, photographs or written correspondence, etc.), the subjects it covers (for example, mining or women's history, etc.), who created the materials within the collection, how it came to Special Collections and Archives, and more information. 

To learn more about finding aids and how to read them, check out our [video tutorial](/special-collections/searchtools.html)."
Research,"What is a ""Reading Room?""","The Reading Room is a designated space on the [first floor of the library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/maps.html) where you may view archival materials. For more information, please see our [Reading Room](/special-collections/plan.html) page."
Research,"What are ""primary sources?"" How are they different from ""secondary sources?""","Primary sources are documents, audio/visual materials, or artifacts that provide first-hand accounts of evidence about a historical topic or event. These materials were created or experienced by the person who created them at the same time that the topic or event in question occurred. This allows current researchers to get as close as possible to what actually happened in the past. Primary sources may include:
- diaries
- letters
- financial records
- audio/video or transcripts of interviews
- photos or videos that capture an event
- newspaper clippings

Secondary sources are documents or audio/visual materials that interpret or analyze a historical event or time period after-the-fact, by people who were not present during the time period or event in question. Typically, secondary sources rely on primary sources to analyze or interpret the past. Secondary sources may include:
- most books or scholarly publications about a topic
- documentaries

Special Collections and Archives houses mostly primary sources with some secondary sources. "
Research,Do I need to cite primary sources I found in the archive?,"Yes. Primary sources and other archival materials are still subject to intellectual property rights, copyright, and trademark laws in the United States. The best way to avoid plagiarism is to use your own words (do not copy text verbatim) and cite all of your sources!"
Research,How do I cite primary sources?,"If your professor or publisher does not require a specific citation style, here is a [general guide](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/citing).

Citations should lead your readers directly to the original sources you have consulted and should include as much identifying information as possible. Citations should include:
- author or creator's name
- title of the work or specific item
- date
- publication information
- collection title
- box and folder number, or photograph number
- repository (name of the archive that houses the materials)

Here's an example from one of our [collections](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv119445/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&q=): 

""Three men and loaded gun rack inside tent,"" undated. Priest Lake Museum Association Photographs, photo #17-01-26. University of Idaho Library, Special Collections and Archives, Moscow, Idaho.

International Jazz Collections,What are the International Jazz Collections (IJC)?,"The International Jazz Collections (IJC) was formally established at the University of Idaho in 2000, featuring papers and photographs of jazz vibraphonist and bandleader Lionel Hampton. The IJC merged with the University of Idaho Library's Special Collections & Archives department in 2007. It is now the preeminent jazz archive in the Pacific Northwest."
International Jazz Collections,Why is it at the University of Idaho?,"Starting in 1984, the University of Idaho developed a strong relationship with jazz vibraphonist Lionel Hampton when he performed at the yearly jazz festival. This relationship led to the jazz festival and the school of music being named after Hampton, and him performing at the festival every year. In 1992, Hampton donated his papers to the University of Idaho with the hope that other jazz artists would contribute and it would be one of the significant jazz archives in the world. In 2000, the IJC was formally established and today holds materials from several great jazz artists, including Al Grey, Ray Brown, Pete and Conte Candoli, and Dizzy Gillespie.

You can find more about IJC and what it includes at our [International Jazz Collections](https://ijc.uidaho.edu) website."
