"How did you determine which journals and databases to include on the list?","For this year’s project, we focused on resources that have a cost per use (total annual price divided by a three-year average of numbers of times used) of greater than $40. In other words, if a $1000/year journal was used 20 times, it would make it on the list due to a price per use of $50. A $200/year journal with 20 uses would have a price per use of $10, and would therefore not be on the list of potential cancellations."
"What do you mean by journal inflation?","Journal and database subscriptions rise at a rate around 5-6% per year. Given that the majority of the library’s budget is devoted to resources of these kinds, this has a substantial impact every year. This is a problem that every academic library is dealing with right now. There have been discussions about the sustainability of this business model within the academic library community for many years; while new models of funding scholarly publishing are currently being pursued, we have not yet seen a significant change in our financial obligations."
"Why don’t you just get a better deal on the same content?","We are members of various library purchasing consortia and negotiate aggressively with publishers and content providers. However, in most cases there is only one source to license specific journals from, creating a monopoly for the providers."
