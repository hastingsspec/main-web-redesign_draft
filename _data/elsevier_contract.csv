Why did we reevaluate our contract with Elsevier?,"<p>Like the rest of the university, the Library has been affected by recent budget holdbacks. These holdbacks, combined with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serials_crisis'>unsustainably high inflation</a> of our electronic resources costs (which make up approximately half of our total budget and approximately 90% of our collections budget), create a situation that requires us to find ways to reduce expenditures.</p> <p>Our contract with Elsevier for their ScienceDirect journal package was up for renewal this year. While the journals and the platform were well used by our university community, it was also our most expensive database package by a large margin. Approximately one-third of our entire annual collections budget went to maintaining this package and the cost was rising quickly due to annual inflation.</p> <p>Right now our only viable option appears to be opting out of our current “big deal” package (see below) in favor of subscribing to a subset of individual Elsevier journal titles. This means that we have lost access to many Elsevier journals, but not all.</p>"
Which journals did we lose?,"<p>At the beginning of 2020 we unfortunately lost the vast majority of our Elsevier content. A small number of essential titles have been retained, as well as archives for titles that we have already paid for. Our <a href='https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID'>catalog</a> should accurately reflect our current subscriptions and access. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact your <a href='https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html'>subject liaison</a>.</p>"
How is our contract structured?,"<p>Until recently, the library’s Elsevier subscription took the form of a “big deal” package. Unlike “a la carte” subscriptions, which allow libraries to pick and choose individual titles, a big deal subscription consists of a bundled assortment of journal titles. While a big deal package allows access to a greater number of titles overall, it means the library has less control over which individual titles are included in the package. Some titles in the package may be heavily used and valued by researchers while others receive low to no use. In a big deal package, the library cannot cancel individual low-use titles without also affecting access to the high-use titles, so we continue to be charged for everything in the package.</p><p>For the library to have complete control over choosing our Elsevier journal title subscriptions, we needed to dismantle the big deal. The result will likely be that prices for each individual journal title that the library selects will increase. However, the library will no longer be forced to pay the ever-increasing big deal price for titles that are infrequently used. This allows the library to tailor our subscription choices to meet the needs of the University of Idaho Library community while staying within our budget.</p>"
How can I get access to the journal titles we have lost?,"<p>There are many resources to fill the gaps if the Library can no longer provide access to a particular journal. The first step for many will be <a href='https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/'>interlibrary loan</a> (ILL). While ILL will not provide the immediate access that a subscription will, our turnaround times are fast. Outside of traditional library modes of delivery, <a href='https://scholar.google.com'>Google Scholar</a> will sometimes find copies of papers that are available via institutional repositories, open access directories, and other websites. While these resources will sometimes be pre-publication versions of the article, they can bridge the gap until a final version of the paper can be obtained.</p><ul>  <li><a href='https://unpaywall.org/'>Unpaywall</a> is a browser extension that will search more than 50,000 open access resources for articles that you find online.</li><li><a href='https://www.doaj.org/'>The Directory of Open Access Journals</a> is another good resource for finding both articles and publication venues.</li><li><a href='https://www.scienceopen.com/'>ScienceOpen</a> features over 58 million article records.</li><li><a href='https://openresearchcentral.org/'>Open Research Central</a> is a portal for open research publishing.</li><li><a href='https://core.ac.uk/'>CORE</a> aggregates outputs from repositories and journals worldwide.</li></ul><p>Your <a href='https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html'>liaison librarian</a> is here to help you find the research you need.

How are other universities responding to these issues?,"<p>Institutions throughout the United States and the world are facing unsustainable big deal contracts. Although these issues recently garnered <a href='https://www.chronicle.com/article/U-of-California-System/245798'>national attention</a> when the University of California system cancelled their Elsevier contract, they are not new.</p><p>Since 2008, at least 33 colleges and universities in the <a href='https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-cancellation-tracking/'>United States</a>, as well as institutions in <a href='https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/major-german-universities-cancel-elsevier-contracts-31208'>Germany</a>, <a href='https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/french-universities-cancel-subscriptions-to-springer-journals-29882'>France</a>, and <a href='https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/sweden-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier-over-open-access-64405'>Sweden</a>, have reduced or cancelled their big deal packages with a number of publishers.</p><p>So far, at least nine land-grant universities have taken similar steps: Kansas State University, Louisiana State University, Mississippi State University, New Mexico State University, University of California System, University of Maryland, University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Missouri, and West Virginia University. By reducing or cancelling their big deals, all institutions, including these nine land-grant universities, have gained greater control and flexibility over their collections budgets, making them better equipped to meet the unique needs of their communities.</p>"
