- <a href=""https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/rx.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">iZotope RX 6</a> - Professional noise reduction software. Includes Denoise, Dereverb, and a spectral editor to remove unwanted noises.

We also have equipment available to record audio in the Studio. Already set up for easy use are two SM58 microphones, MPK Mini MIDI keyboard, and a Focusrite audio interface with 1/4"" input. These options should suffice for podcasts, single track recordings, simple MIDI input, and simple video voiceover. 

The Studio is currently optimized with light sound paneling to record podcasts, short films, and interviews. Other audio recording is possible, but do not expect the same outcome as a recording booth or soundproofed room. Certain musical instruments are allowed as long as volumes are kept at an appropriate level. No percussive instruments whatsoever. Be warned that there is a noticeable hum in the room, and the elevator and door adjacent to the room will be picked up by most microphone setups. See iZotope RX 6 software to deal with these issues."
