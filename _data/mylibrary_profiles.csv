Hayley Fleischman,hayley.jpg,Elementary Education,undergrad,"My Library has a variety of free resources that really add up to great savings. Knowing these services are available when I need them makes life as a student less stressful. I can use textbooks at the library rather than buying them myself! The library has a huge DVD collection I can use and I can check out video cameras for projects. These are just some of the resources that have helped me. The more I learn about what my library has to offer, the more impressed I am."
