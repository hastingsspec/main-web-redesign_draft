So, say you find an article via Google that asks for you to sign in to access it, just click on the bookmarklet link in your bookmarks bar and this tool will automatically log you in and grant you access, if the library subscribes to the journal or database in which it's held.

Unpaywall,"Unpaywall is an index of nearly 25 million free scholarly articles maintained by nonprofit [Our Research](https://ourresearch.org). They crawl tens of thousands of hosting locations, including institutional and disciplinary repositories, academic journal websites, and more. Matching between article versions is based on DOIs. Install the browser extension to check for open versions of any article.",https://unpaywall.org/products/extension
Open Access Button,"Open Access Button queries indexes of open content to find freely available versions of articles. OA Button can do fuzzy matching, going beyond Unpaywall's DOI only search. Furthermore, if the article is not found in the system, it will mediate the process of requesting an open copy from the author. As [they say](https://blog.openaccessbutton.org/making-more-research-open-access-one-paper-at-a-time-25b95cd36c8f), major publishers permit authors to post a copy of the article in institutional repositories. Try it on the website or install the browser extension.",https://openaccessbutton.org/
Lazy Scholar,"Unlike some of the others, Lazy Scholar is focused on easing access to content using existing indices, regardless of their openness. It has settings to enable authentication through a proxy server to access material through U of I subscriptions. It collects citation information, scans articles for references and other content, and exports papers to reference manager software. It is maintained by researcher [Colby Vorland](https://twitter.com/nutsci).",http://www.lazyscholar.org/
Kopernio,"Kopernio searches Web of Science and Pubmed then connects to library subscriptions and open access options to simplify access to articles. Developed by Clarivate Analytics, the company that operates the Web of Science and Endnote, Kopernio's primary value is ease of accessing materials, as well as quick, efficient searching. It is offered via a freemium model that provides PDF storage and sharing with others.",https://kopernio.com/
Google Scholar Button,"The Google Scholar Button treats any webpage like an article and looks it up in Google Scholar. It provides shortcuts to some of Google Scholar's features, like citing articles or other versions, as well as the search engine itself. The particular value of the Google Scholar Button is that you can highlight some chunk of text on a webpage and with a click of the button, you can search for items with that phrasing. It's an efficient means to finding other articles on related topics reasonably quickly. And since it provides a proxy link for items that the U of I subscribes to, it works as an alternative tool for accessing subscribed content, not just open content.",https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-scholar-button/ldipcbpaocekfooobnbcddclnhejkcpn?hl=en
