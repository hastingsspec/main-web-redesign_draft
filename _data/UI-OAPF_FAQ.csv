Guidelines,What happens if an article has multiple authors?,"The fund will cover a maximum of $2000.00 per article. The article maximum is prorated per University of Idaho author and determined by dividing the article process charges (APCs) by the number of U of I authors. Each eligible U of I author can receive up to the prorated portion of the APCs (subject to their individual author cap), while the prorated portion for non-U of I authors is not eligible for funding. For example, if an article had two eligible U of I authors and one non-U of I author, the proration would be $2000 / 2 U of I authors = up to $1000 per U of I author."
Guidelines,Are there caps on funding?,"Yes, the funding cap is $2000.00 per article and $3000.00 per author/year. Based on funding availability, authors may apply for funding multiple times until their cap is met, funds are exhausted, or the fiscal year ends."

Guidelines,"Can the U of I OAPF be used to cover other open access publication types, such as conference presentations and books?","Not at this time. Other open access publication types, such as books, book chapters, and conference proceedings may be supported in the future."
Procedures and Process,What is the review process and who decides which applications receive funding?,"When applications are received, the U of I OAPF Fund Manager will use a standard rubric to evaluate applications against the eligibility criteria and approve or reject funding requests. The U of I OAPF Fund Manager will then share funding decisions and a copy of the rubric with applicants via email."
Procedures and Process,What is the procedure for payment or reimbursement?,"Upon funding approval, the author will forward the invoice directly to the Library's Administrative Financial Specialist and the U of I OAPF Fund Manager, or direct the journal to do so. The article processing charges will be paid directly to the journal publisher. The fund prefers to pay journals directly, thus minimizing out-of-pocket cost to the authors. However, in case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of the payment. The U of I OAPF will review other possible payment options as needed, e.g paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers."
