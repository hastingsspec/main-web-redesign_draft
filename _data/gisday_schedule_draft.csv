9:15 am - 10:00 am,"Whitewater Room and Zoom","GeoAI for Science and the Science of GeoAI","Wenwen Li (School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, Arizona State University)","Keynote presentation","AI, especially deep learning, has transformed many science and engineering disciplines because of its outstanding capabilities in learning and extracting new patterns and knowledge in a data-driven manner. Geospatial science is an ideal domain to extensively apply and further boost AI research because of its vast availability of diverse big data, intriguing and complex human-environmental interactions, as well as its central role in enabling location-based analysis. In less than a decade, we have witnessed a rapidly growing interest and progress of GeoAI research -- the transdisciplinary expansion of AI in geography and its sibling domains in spatial, environmental, and urban sciences. This talk will explore the trending research in GeoAI and discuss how the science of GeoAI can be advanced. It will also cover how GeoAI can advance scientific discovery, using the tracking of Arctic environmental change as a use study.

**Presenter Bio**

Wenwen Li is a Professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at Arizona State University. Her research interest is geographic information science with a focus on developing integrated and smart cyberinfrastructure to revolutionize knowledge discovery in environmental and social sciences. In recent years, she has been pioneering the integration of AI with geospatial sciences, and have developed a series of spatial explicit GeoAI models for environmental analysis. Dr. Li's research was funded by multiple funding agencies. She was the recipient of the US National Science Foundation's early CAREER Award and Mid-Career Advancement Award. She is also a Fellow of the American Association of Geography (AAG) and a Fellow of University Consortium of Geographic Information Science.
