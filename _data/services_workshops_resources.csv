This workshop will go over the basics of metrics and altmetrics, discuss current trends and limitations of metrics, and explore various scholarly metrics tools. </span><a role=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#metrics"" class=""expand""><span class=""fas fa-plus-circle"" aria-hidden=""true""></span><span class=""sr-only"">expand</span></a>","<a href=""http://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/individual/n19511"">Annie Gaines</a>","<a href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/workshops/Meaningful_metrics_workshop.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""fas fa-file""></span>Slides</a><br> <a href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/workshops/Meaningful_metrics_handout.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""fas fa-file""></span>Handout</a>"
Introducing Jupyter Notebook for Python and R,2016-03-02,"<a href=""http://jupyter.org/"">Jupyter Notebook</a> is a powerful tool for writing, using, and sharing code, perfect for academic teaching and learning. <span id=""jupyter"" class=""collapse"">For researchers using Python and other languages, it is an efficient interface to iteratively explore data, present live code to students, or share data driven visualizations with colleagues. If you are just getting started with programming, it is also a great interactive environment for learning and prototyping code. This workshop will introduce the unique features that code notebooks offer to researchers and students. Participants will learn how to install and use Jupyter with the IPython and R kernels. Intended for: students, faculty, and staff interested in learning about code notebooks, sharing code, or learning to code. Complete beginners interested in learning about programming with Python are welcome and encouraged to attend! </span><a role=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#jupyter"" class=""expand""><span class=""fas fa-plus-circle"" aria-hidden=""true""></span><span class=""sr-only"">expand</span></a>","<a href=""http://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/individual/n43629"">Evan Williamson</a>","<a href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/workshops/UIdaho_Jupyter_workshop.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""fas fa-file""></span>Slides</a>"

Data Visualization 101: Concepts and Tools,2016-02-03,"Visual Analytics (VA) and Information Visualization are booming interdisciplinary fields grappling with new methods to interact with and comprehend complex data. <span id=""viz101"" class=""collapse"">Informed by theories of interactive design, human perception, and statistical computation, VA tools enable researchers to ask new questions and transform abstract information into meaningful representations. This workshop will provide a brief introduction to the underlying concepts of visualization and VA, as well as present several VA tools freely available for academic use. It will include a demonstration of <a href=""http://www.tableau.com/academic"">Tableau Desktop</a>, a powerful and flexible visualization software used in many industries. Participants will be provided with further resources to explore the field and find software with free academic licenses. Intended for: students, faculty, and staff with an interest in exploring data and creating visualizations. Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop. </span><a role=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#viz101"" class=""expand""><span class=""fas fa-plus-circle"" aria-hidden=""true""></span><span class=""sr-only"">expand</span></a>","<a href=""http://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/individual/n43629"">Evan Williamson</a>","<a href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/workshops/UIdaho_DataViz101_workshop.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""fas fa-file""></span>Slides</a>"
