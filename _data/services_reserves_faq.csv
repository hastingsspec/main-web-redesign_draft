Fall 2020,What's the deadline for having reserve materials available by the first day of school?,"**August 17th**. We're happy to add readings to your course materials after that date, with the caveat that your requests will be added to the queue in the order in which they were received. Please also note that our reserve system uploads on a 24 hour cycle, eliminating the likelihood of same-day access regardless of queue length. Be sure to get us your requests early to avoid delays!"
Fall 2020,Can I put a print book on course reserves this fall?,"Yes, although we will also be working with you to identify electronic versions of your existing course materials. Following the latest [Safety guidelines](https://www.imls.gov/news/research-shows-virus-undetectable-five-highly-circulated-library-materials-after-three-days) for libraries, all physical reserve items will be quarantined for 3 days after each use, meaning print materials will not be as consistently accessible to your students as in prior semesters. In contrast, e-books or scanned book chapters provide the most flexibility and consistent access to students regardless of course delivery over the semester. Please contact your [subject liaison](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html) to explore electronic options such as ebooks, articles, or streaming video."
Fall 2020,Why should I have online course reserves if we are having an in-person semester?,"Physical items, especially high-touch items like print reserves, have pandemic-related safety issues and are less flexible in the event that students need to self-isolate, are ill, or when courses go online after Thanksgiving. Virtual or electronic reserves allow us the opportunity to provide consistent access to the greatest number of students, regardless of course delivery method this fall. We will be working with course instructors to make electronic access available as a backup for your students. "
Fall 2020,How can I make my existing print course readings available electronically?,"In many cases, the library may be able to purchase an e-book of your course text or secure licensing for streaming video, or we can work with you to digitize sections of your print textbook depending on the results of a [fair use analysis](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/reserve/fairuse.html). Please email libreserve@uidaho.edu to begin the process. "
Fall 2020,Can the library just scan my textbook and put that online?,"Kind of. Due to [fair use guidelines](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/reserve/fairuse.html), we can't digitize a textbook and place the whole copy online. However, we can digitize sections of textbooks, and we're happy to work with you to determine whether scanning a print book or a library e-book is the best solution for you. "
Fall 2020,I want the library to buy an e-book for use by my class. How do I do that?,"Reach out to your [liaison librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html) as soon as possible. We can work with publishers and vendors to see if an e-book is available for your course text, and if so, purchase a license for the content. There are many variables when it comes to e-books, so if an e-book is not available for your course text, we will do whatever we can to explore other options."
Fall 2020,"I teach a film class, how can I place videos on reserve?","The library has several [streaming platforms](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/reserve/video.html), including Kanopy and Swank, and in many cases we can provide virtual options for physical DVDs. If you need to view a streaming video from a provider other than Kanopy or Swank, or for more information please contact Jodi Haire (haire@uidaho.edu), your [subject liaison](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html), or libreserve@uidaho.edu. "
Fall 2020,I'm still adding readings to my course and want to explore other virtual options. Where should I look?,"Your [liaison librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html) can help you find virtual options, either through our electronic databases, streaming media platforms, or [open educational resources](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/oer). Options include: 

- Identifying already licensed library resources that could meet your needs.
- Scanning portions of print materials within fair use and provide pdfs through course reserves.
- Identifying streaming options for some DVDs owned by the library.
- Licensing available streaming media as requested by instructors.
- Requesting e-books for purchase when possible."
Fall 2020,How do I access materials from off-campus?,"We have a full page dedicated to that, check the [Covid-19 access page](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/covid19/access.html)."
Leganto,What is Leganto?,Leganto is a library plug-in that allows students to access library course reserves directly from your BBLearn course. It is an additional feature of our existing library systems. Learn more on our [Leganto information page](/services/reserve/leganto.html)
Leganto FAQ,How do I get Leganto?,Leganto is already embedded in your BBLearn course; you just have to activate it. Follow our [guide to activate Leganto](/services/reserve/leganto.html) and make your reading lists available from within your course.
Leganto FAQ,What are the benefits of using Leganto?,"The most significant benefit is to your students, who can now access library course reserves directly from BBLearn. The library will be expanding instructor permissions over the next year, allowing instructors to have more agency in adding materials to their library course reserves. More training and information coming soon!"
Leganto FAQ,I don’t use library course reserves but I do have readings linked in my BBLearn course. Can I use Leganto?,Yes! We can work with you to activate Leganto for your course; please email libreserve@uidaho.edu and we can help you get started on the process.
Leganto FAQ,Do I have to use Leganto?,"No. Library course reserves will continue to be available to your students on our library website, regardless of whether or not you activate Leganto in BBLearn."
Leganto FAQ,I need help activating Leganto or I have more questions,We're happy to help; please email libreserve@uidaho.edu and we can walk you through the process and answer any questions you might have. 
Requests,Do I need to fill out a request form when I submit materials for Ereserve?,"Yes, as the form will prompt you for all the information we are required to have on file. Identify items in the same manner as the appear in your syllabus. We will list them in a similar manner on the system unless you give us instructions to group them differently."
Requests,Do I need to fill out the form each time I add materials to Reserves for an existing class?,"No, not as long as all the pertinent information is provided instructor's name, class and course number, full citation, and whether it's new material or pages that you've used for this class previously. Using the form is usually easier than remembering all the required information each time."
Requests,What's the best way to submit a request?,"With an on-line or in-library form, at least 2 weeks before the start of the semester, and using primarily electronic materials or copies that are ready for scanning."
Requests,Can you just clean up and recopy my personal photocopies for scanning?,This needs to be done at your end. Materials submitted that are not ready for scanning will be put on In-Library Reserves or returned to you. We prefer to copy or scan from the original source.
Requests,Can I just send you my reading list?,"Submitting a reading list is acceptable, but is a much slower process. Allow more lead-time for obtaining call numbers, pulling the items and copying."
Requests,Can I put the same materials on In-Library Reserve?,"No, we have chosen not to duplicate the effort."
Requests,If I teach a class every semester or every other semester and want to use the same materials will you just leave the class available on the Ereserve site?,"We are unable to leave the class up due to the copyright policies, but it can be retrieved easily enough. Contact the <a href=""mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu"">Reserve Desk</a> for the specifics."
Requests,How do the students access the materials?,The Reserve list can be accessed from any of the university computer labs or from their home computers. They will need to have the latest Adobe Reader version loaded. The materials can be read on-line and/or printed. An advantage of accessing them from the university computer labs is that it allows them to use the print quota they are allocated each semester.
Requests,What are the advantages of Ereserve over In-library Reserve?,The students can access the material at any time of the day from any available Internet connection and don't have to worry about the file being checked out when they need it. They can also use the file however long they would like without being concerned about late fees accruing.
Limitations,How many items can I put on Reserve for each class?,"Only 5 items per week can be submitted during peak times. Otherwise, you may request any reasonable amount of items for your class size and just indicate which need to be processed first. A guideline would be 15 to 30 per class."
Limitations,How much out of one book or journal issue can I use within fair use?,"One chapter from a book or 10%, whichever is LESS, and up to two articles from a particular issue of a journal. See ""How to"" for further details. Use of more than this would require requesting permission from the publisher."
Timing,When should I submit materials ready for scanning?,It depends on the number of items. A general rule would be to allow at least a week from the date the students will need it. During peak periods allow more time and indicate priority in groups of five items or less.
Timing,When should I submit my reading list?,It depends on the size of the list. A general rule would be to allow at least two weeks from the date the students will need it. During peak periods allow more time and indicate priority in groups of five items or less. It is advisable to check the UI catalog first to determine what we do and do not own. Any materials that we don't own will need to be provided by you.
Timing,"If my students need the materials right away, can you just put them on In-Library Reserve and then scan them later?","Due to demand and time constraints, materials left without ample time will be put on In-Library reserve only. Be sure to allow enough lead-time and submit copies that are ready for scanning or use materials available electronically (see Electronic Materials, below)."
Scanning / Submissions,"What do you mean by ""submit only materials ready for scanning""?","We need you to supply originals or clean, one-sided copies that include the complete source (copies of the title pages). Please let us know whether you do or don't want your copies returned."
Scanning / Submissions,"What do you mean by ""complete sources"" and what's the easiest way to provide it?","We are required to have the complete citation for either type of Library Reserve, just as you would have to cite them in a published bibliography submission. The complete source has to be available on any copies submitted for Reserve, not just listed on your request form or reading list. Copying the two title pages in the front of a book or the title page of the particular journal issue is usually the best way to accomplish this."
Scanning / Submissions,How are the materials obtained and scanned for Ereserve?,"They are obtained from your sources or the UI Library and are scanned as clean, one-sided copies or from the original. We currently have one scanner in operation for the Reserve department."
Scanning / Submissions,"Once my materials are scanned, will I be able to edit the images or copy them to another file?","No, they will come up as pdf files in Adobe Acrobat. This protection is required and primarily designed to assure that they are only used by the individual student."
Scanning / Submissions,Where will my scanned material be stored if I choose to use it again?,We keep previously used materials on CDs for 3 years/ 6 semesters in case of future need. Please indicate if we've used the item for you previously on Ereserve for this class or another so it can be retrieved from the CD.
Electronic Materials,How do I find items that are available electronically?,"Files created by you or found from your electronic subscriptions can be sent as an email attachment as pdf or Microsoft Word files. They would need to include complete sources if they are published materials, or for unpublished works, written permission from the author if the author is not you. Full text journal articles can be found from the Library home page through ""find articles/general interest"" or just by searching the UI catalog. Watch for the ""full text available"" indication next to the item. Please indicate if you know an item is available as a direct link and we will create the link from here."
Electronic Materials,Why are electronically available items preferable to use?,Most items that can be directly linked to the Ereserve site do not require copyright permission when used for subsequent semesters due to the Library owning subscription rights. They are also much quicker to add to the Ereserve system.
Copyright,Why do some of the files have to be password protected?,Due to federal copyright restrictions we need to restrict the use to only the students that are enrolled in the class on most published works. We can also apply this password protection to your individual materials if you wish. Students will use their normal UI NetID receive access. Please encourage your students to ask for help in the library if they have any problems with the Reserve System.
Copyright,Do I have to go through the same copyright permission process as I would for a course packet?,"No, we take care of pursuing permissions, but only if you are using the materials for more than one semester for the same class. Because we are not creating a new document by compiling all your readings, nor providing printed copies for each student we are able to use the materials for one semester as educational fair use and are not required to seek permission."
Copyright,Does the publisher have to give permission to have materials available electronically?,"Yes, but only after the first semester of use and only on items we don't have the ability to directly link legally, i.e. via subscription rights."
Copyright,Do I need to seek copyright permission and who pays for it?,"No you don't. We prefer to do that, after the initial semester of fair use, so we are sure that the permission specifically covers the use. At the present time, the University of Idaho Library is paying for these costs. The charges for electronic postings are currently running 3 to 4 times as much as In-library Reserve items and are usually good for one semester only. They are based on the number of pages and the number of students in the class, along with the individual fee assigned by the various publishers. Occasionally we are simply turned down. As an author submitting materials for publication you may want to negotiate your ownership rights, when possible, if you foresee wanting to use the materials in your teaching to avoid this potential problem."
Copyright,When will I know if permission has been granted?,Usually within a few weeks we will be notified of their terms. Sometimes we don't get responses from the publishers until later in the semester. We will notify you by email if there are problems and suggest other ways to provide the materials for your students.
Copyright,Why do I need written permission to use students' work (or any unpublished work that is not my own)?,The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects any use of student papers without their written permission. The permission form is available from the Reserve home page. There are always copyright implications when using unpublished materials not authored by the user.
