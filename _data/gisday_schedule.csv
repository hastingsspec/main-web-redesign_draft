10:00 am - 10:45 am,Zoom,Operationalizing UAVs for Forest and Rangeland Management,Matthew M. Aghai (Director of Biological Research & Development at DroneSeed Co),"This keynote presentation will provide an overview of the technology and research supporting DroneSeed's innovative, data-driven approach using UAVs for large scale post-disturbance revegetation and native plant management.","Through a venture-backed model, DroneSeed is able to rapidly prototype and operationalize critical software, hardware, standard operating procedures, and biotechnology to meet the needs of a broad customer base in the revegetation space. Wildfire and other large-scale ecosystem disturbances are increasing in frequency and severity, while operational constraints seem to be increasing for land owners. Constraints to post-disturbance revegetation include accessibility to remote areas, difficulty distributing seed precisely at scale, invasive species mitigation, and associated costs. DroneSeed is developing a multipronged approach to revegetation using UAVs that is applicable to large scale post-disturbance revegetation and native plant management, at an effective cost. DroneSeed is increasing operational capacity using swarm technology, enabling multiple heavy lift aircraft to move material payloads across restoration areas with increased precision compared to conventional aircraft and manual systems. The company is precedent setting in the regulatory environment allowing for this work. The presentation will provide an overview of the companyâ€™s technology, present and future opportunities, and outline the research and development supporting their data-driven approach. 

**Presenter Bio**

Matthew is currently the Director of Research and Development at DroneSeed Co in Seattle. Previously his work as a consultant had sent him around the world to pursue reforestation and native plant restoration for both ecological and industrial applications. He has trained and practiced as a nurseryman and regeneration specialist and has conducted research on a gamut of topics from the plant microbiome to tree community ecology. He has previous degrees from Purdue University and the University of Idaho, and in his limited spare time is wrapping up a PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle. Reforestation and native plant restoration are his mission."

At the onset of the pandemic, the Center for Resilient Communities (CRC) at the University of Idaho and the Earth Systems Research Center at the University of New Hampshire developed a framework to analyze impacted areas at the national scale. Representatives from both groups will present the following topics within the process: a) the Science of COVID-19 food system vulnerability assessments, b) physical / hydrological assessments to support the process, and c) pulling it all together with tools for analysis and representation."
