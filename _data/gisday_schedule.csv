9:15 am - 10:00 am,"Whitewater Room and Zoom","Geoprivacy and GIS: Avenues for Engagement","Dara Seidl (Associate Professor of Geographic Information Systems, Colorado Mountain College)<br><em><small>Presenting virtually</small></em>","Keynote presentation","GIS Day 2022 will mark twenty years since the release of Mark Monmonier's influential book on geospatial technology and privacy, *Spying with Maps*. What has changed in the geoprivacy world in the last twenty years? How have perceived geoprivacy risks from two decades ago panned out, and what new directions and concerns have emerged? This talk will identify evolving practices in the collection and stewardship of sensitive location data and address a lingering concern: how to engage future purveyors of spatial data in cultivating geoprivacy.

**Presenter Bio**

Dr. Dara Seidl is a geographer and GIS scientist who loves to help students effectively capture, produce, analyze, display, and communicate geographic data. She is passionate about incorporating ethics into geography education. Her scholarly research centers on geoprivacy, which is the right of individuals to control their personal location data. She was named a 2019-2020 EthicalGEO Fellow by the American Geographical Society to develop an [educational toolbox of short films on geoprivacy](https://ethicalgeo.org/dara-seidl/). She regularly published on cartographic techniques to protect privacy in mapping and societal reactions to personal location collection."

Current approaches to sharing personal location information is often limited to sharing a single spatial resolution with all individuals, regardless of relation, and with little control over how this content is shared. In this talk I propose a set of design goals and a design pattern for sharing personal location information that are realized through a prototype mobile web application called PrivyTo."
