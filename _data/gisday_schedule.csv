9:15 am - 10:00 am,"Whitewater Room and Zoom","Geoprivacy and GIS: Avenues for Engagement","Dara Seidl (Associate Professor of Geographic Information Systems, Colorado Mountain College)<br><em><small>Presenting virtually</small></em>","Keynote presentation","GIS Day 2022 will mark twenty years since the release of Mark Monmonier's influential book on geospatial technology and privacy, *Spying with Maps*. What has changed in the geoprivacy world in the last twenty years? How have perceived geoprivacy risks from two decades ago panned out, and what new directions and concerns have emerged? This talk will identify evolving practices in the collection and stewardship of sensitive location data and address a lingering concern: how to engage future purveyors of spatial data in cultivating geoprivacy.

**Presenter Bio**

Dr. Dara Seidl is a geographer and GIS scientist who loves to help students effectively capture, produce, analyze, display, and communicate geographic data. She is passionate about incorporating ethics into geography education. Her scholarly research centers on geoprivacy, which is the right of individuals to control their personal location data. She was named a 2019-2020 EthicalGEO Fellow by the American Geographical Society to develop an [educational toolbox of short films on geoprivacy](https://ethicalgeo.org/dara-seidl/). She regularly published on cartographic techniques to protect privacy in mapping and societal reactions to personal location collection."

- **Open source human rights investigations and their evidentiary implications**, Matty Murphy (International Studies, University of Idaho) - This talk will present initial findings of research into how open source HR investigations are conducted, as well as the broader global implications of such investigations in the 21st century.
- **Getting Involved in the GIS Community**, Kara Utter (Northern Rockies chapter of the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association) - This presentation will cover who NR-URISA and URISA are and what we do for the GIS Community. It will cover a little about our history, what our current focus is, and why it's important to get involved with professional GIS organizations like ours. I will also emphasize the importance for Students and Young Professionals to get involved to help network and make connections.
- **Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs**, Jennifer Hinds (Research Computing and Data Services, University of Idaho) - Rendering large raster images when developing web mapping applications can be a challenge. This is where Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) save the day.

11:20 am - 11:45 am,"Whitewater Room and Zoom","Location sharing and geoprivacy preservation","Grant McKenzie (Assistant Professor of Spatial Data Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada)<br><em><small>Presenting virtually</small></em>","Invited special topics presentation","Concern over the privacy of one's personal location is at an all-time high, yet the desire to share our lives with friends, family, and the public persists. Current approaches to sharing personal location information is often limited to sharing a single spatial resolution with all individuals, regardless of relation, and with little control over how this content is shared. In this talk I propose a set of design goals and a design pattern for sharing personal location information that are realized through a prototype mobile web application called PrivyTo."

- **Developing a Method for Quantifying the Thermal and Hydrologic Impacts of Beaver Habitat Using Thermal Infrared Imagery**, Matthew Steinwurtzel (Fish and Wildlife Sciences, University of Idaho) - Historically, beaver-mediated habitat would have been a ubiquitous and multifunctional aspect of Idaho's river and riparian ecosystems. Beaver habitats have been demonstrated to increase groundwater exchange, maintain surface water during drought or low flows, and promote thermal heterogeneity by increasing groundwater and surface water exchanges. As climate change will continue to impact riparian habitat and riverine ecosystems through changes in precipitation and temperature, the identification of restoration activities for managers that promote and facilitate cold-water refuges for imperiled salmonids is critical. Using Thermal Infrared Imagery (TIR), we are developing a methodology that maps and models the thermal profile of salmonid-bearing watersheds. This applied methodology can be adopted and used to address the spatial and temporal limitations of typical large-scale riparian ecosystem investigations in other watersheds. 
- **Standalone GPS devices - still relevant today?**, Dave Pitney (Geography, University of Idaho) - With the widespread adoption of smartphones and their 'good enough' GPS capabilities, is there still a role for standalone GPS devices? It depends on the use case. Presentation will conclude with a preview of our digital topographic maps for Garmin GPS devices.
- **Keeping Watch: Mapping Idaho's Fire Lookouts Through Lived Experience**, Michael Decker (CDIL and Confluence Lab, University of Idaho) - Keeping Watch is a geo-spatial narrative project that locates oral history testimonies from former and current fire lookouts on a GIS interface. Its aim is to trace shifting perspectives of space/ place through the gaze of fire lookouts--both objectively as tower technology and subjectively as human presence.

The reporters found that local law enforcement has been using the tool to track suspects in criminal investigations, sometimes without a search warrant. Fog Reveal searches billions of records from 250 million devices that police use to create ""patterns of life"" for people under investigation."

- **A New Database Initiative for Geologic Mapping in Idaho**, Nathan Hopkins (Idaho Geological Survey) - The Idaho Geological Survey publishes freely available geologic data, including geologic mapping, of interest to diverse stakeholders in Idaho. This talk will introduce an initiative to create a seamless 1:24,000-scale compilation of the geologic mapping of Idaho in a new geodatabase schema consistent with national standards.
