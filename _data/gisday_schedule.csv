Geospatial science is an ideal domain to extensively apply and further boost AI research because of its vast availability of diverse big data, intriguing and complex human-environmental interactions, as well as its central role in enabling location-based analysis. In less than a decade, we have witnessed a rapidly growing interest and progress of GeoAI research -- the transdisciplinary expansion of AI in geography and its sibling domains in spatial, environmental, and urban sciences. This talk will explore the trending research in GeoAI and discuss how the science of GeoAI can be advanced. It will also cover how GeoAI can advance scientific discovery, using the tracking of Arctic environmental change as a use study.

**Presenter Bio**

Wenwen Li is a Professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at Arizona State University. Her research interest is geographic information science with a focus on developing integrated and smart cyberinfrastructure to revolutionize knowledge discovery in environmental and social sciences. In recent years, she has been pioneering the integration of AI with geospatial sciences, and have developed a series of spatial explicit GeoAI models for environmental analysis. Dr. Li's research was funded by multiple funding agencies. She was the recipient of the US National Science Foundation's early CAREER Award and Mid-Career Advancement Award. She is also a Fellow of the American Association of Geography (AAG) and a Fellow of University Consortium of Geographic Information Science.

11:20 am - 11:45 am,"Whitewater Room and Zoom","Location sharing and geoprivacy preservation","Grant McKenzie (Assistant Professor of Spatial Data Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada)<br><em><small>Presenting virtually</small></em>","Invited special topics presentation","Concern over the privacy of one's personal location is at an all-time high, yet the desire to share our lives with friends, family, and the public persists. Current approaches to sharing personal location information is often limited to sharing a single spatial resolution with all individuals, regardless of relation, and with little control over how this content is shared. In this talk I propose a set of design goals and a design pattern for sharing personal location information that are realized through a prototype mobile web application called PrivyTo.

- **Developing a Method for Quantifying the Thermal and Hydrologic Impacts of Beaver Habitat Using Thermal Infrared Imagery**, Matthew Steinwurtzel (Fish and Wildlife Sciences, University of Idaho) - Historically, beaver-mediated habitat would have been a ubiquitous and multifunctional aspect of Idaho's river and riparian ecosystems. Beaver habitats have been demonstrated to increase groundwater exchange, maintain surface water during drought or low flows, and promote thermal heterogeneity by increasing groundwater and surface water exchanges. As climate change will continue to impact riparian habitat and riverine ecosystems through changes in precipitation and temperature, the identification of restoration activities for managers that promote and facilitate cold-water refuges for imperiled salmonids is critical. Using Thermal Infrared Imagery (TIR), we are developing a methodology that maps and models the thermal profile of salmonid-bearing watersheds. This applied methodology can be adopted and used to address the spatial and temporal limitations of typical large-scale riparian ecosystem investigations in other watersheds. 
- **Standalone GPS devices - still relevant today?**, Dave Pitney (Geography, University of Idaho) - With the widespread adoption of smartphones and their 'good enough' GPS capabilities, is there still a role for standalone GPS devices? It depends on the use case. Presentation will conclude with a preview of our digital topographic maps for Garmin GPS devices.
- **Keeping Watch: Mapping Idaho's Fire Lookouts Through Lived Experience**, Michael Decker (CDIL and Confluence Lab, University of Idaho) - Keeping Watch is a geo-spatial narrative project that locates oral history testimonies from former and current fire lookouts on a GIS interface. Its aim is to trace shifting perspectives of space/ place through the gaze of fire lookouts--both objectively as tower technology and subjectively as human presence.

The reporters found that local law enforcement has been using the tool to track suspects in criminal investigations, sometimes without a search warrant. Fog Reveal searches billions of records from 250 million devices that police use to create ""patterns of life"" for people under investigation.

- **A New Database Initiative for Geologic Mapping in Idaho**, Nathan Hopkins (Idaho Geological Survey) - The Idaho Geological Survey publishes freely available geologic data, including geologic mapping, of interest to diverse stakeholders in Idaho. This talk will introduce an initiative to create a seamless 1:24,000-scale compilation of the geologic mapping of Idaho in a new geodatabase schema consistent with national standards.
- **A State Project to help PSAPs getting ready for NG9-1-1**, Wilma Robertson (Office of Information Technology Services, State of Idaho) - The State received funding to help Public Safety Answering Points improve their GIS Data for five Core datasets to get Idaho ready to switch from E911 to NG9-1-1. Learn about the efforts currently underway.
- **Using multi-temporal LiDAR to assess fire impacts on tree growth**, Aaron Sparks (Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences, University of Idaho) - This talk will give a brief overview of current research efforts on the U of I Experimental Forest aimed at understanding forest growth dynamics using multi-temporal airborne LiDAR, including fire impacts on tree growth.
