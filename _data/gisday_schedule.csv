TBA,"Crest/Horizon Rooms, Idaho Commons (4th floor)",GIS & Spatial Machine Learning: Transforming Our Planet’s Pulse to Action,"Dr. Orhun Aydin, PhD | Researcher | Product Engineer, Esri","Space and time are essential components for a wide spectrum of problems ranging from designing resilient cities to understanding natural systems of our planet. Modern developments in GIS can integrate vast amounts and types of space-time data, enabling an interconnected nervous system for our planet. Harnessing the power of this nervous system requires connecting it to intelligent systems that can reveal critical patterns and relationships to guide decisions that shape our future. The increased quantity and diversity of data sources pose both challenges and opportunities for this connection. One big step in modern GIS is enabling extensible and interoperable systems to connect powerful analysis with big data. Interoperable GIS paves the path for multidisciplinary spatial problem solving to transform big spatial data into deep understanding with modern spatial machine learning. ESRI is an example of one such platform, where interoperability and extensibility are essential for sophisticated spatial problem solving to understand “the where” and the “the when” to make decisions about “the how”. ESRI's platform fuses state-of-the-art GIS technologies for mapping and spatial analysis with established open-source technologies. This keynote will showcase components of modern GIS as the central system for understanding our planet. Components of the ESRI ecosystem will be elaborated for ways in which they can be utilized for interoperable GIS connected to a numerical nervous system, such as ESRI’s Living Atlas, to solve our planet’s pressing problems.
Speaker bio: Orhun Aydin is a researcher in ESRI's Spatial Statistics team and a Lecturer in the Spatial Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Prior to his position in ESRI, he conducted his PhD research on uncertainty quantification pertaining to unobserved geologic faults in Stanford School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences. His research interests include forecasting and understanding Earth systems via spatial and spatio-temporal statistical models. His theoretical work involves developing general mathematical frameworks for modelling, mining and representing spatial and spatio-temporal data. In addition to his research work, he is a product engineer in the R-ArcGIS Bridge project."
