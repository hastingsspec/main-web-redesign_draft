Our work should promulgate a reading of place that acknowledges the complex cultural, ecological, and biochemical processes taking place above, below, and within the urban ground. In this talk, I'll share my experiences in teaching, analyzing, and designing patterns of living, stewarding, and connection. Using examples from my work on the NWF Urban Wildlife Connectivity Study, the Upper LA River and Tributaries Plan, and Destination Crenshaw, the talk will highlight what happens ""behind the scenes"" - the messy process of collaborative design, analysis techniques, and community narratives.

Jean Yang is a landscape designer, urban planner, and educator focused on design-driven, equity-focused, and benefits-based landscapes. A Senior Associate at Studio-MLA and Visiting Faculty Fellow in Design for Spatial Justice at the University of Oregon, Yang has analyzed, designed, and fought for public space in historically challenged areas. Her projects include Destination Crenshaw - is a 1.3 mileâ€“long open-air museum dedicated to preserving the history and culture of African American, the Upper LA River and Tributaries plan - which will provide new and enhanced open spaces to over a million people, and the LA County Parks and Recreation Strategic Plan, which aligns one of the largest landowners in Los Angeles with the fight for justice and equity. Yang has received Azure Award for Urban Design Vision, the Southern California ASLA Merit Award, and the ASLA Honor Award."

Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing technology that provides high-resolution elevation data. With the influx of new data, there are many opportunities for local communities to use this information for natural hazard management, strategic development, and conservation, among other applications. The [Storymap](https://boisestate.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=63fc0118b554441589d7793e1c38ff1d) blends texts and visuals to explore lidar acquisition and implementation in Idaho. This information is intended for anyone that may want to use lidar or already uses lidar including GIS technicians, planners, engineers, academics, and artists, among others. As a compilation of stories from Idahoans representing various government agencies and academic institutions, this Storymap gives background on how lidar works, its applications in Idaho, and instructions/resources on how to acquire lidar. We hope this is a place for Idahoans to learn about the usability of lidar and be inspired to use it towards forming a resilient Idaho.

Tara Pozzi is a first-year PhD student in the Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior at UC Davis. Her main research focuses on behavior and decision-making processes that influence a community's adaptive capacity and resilience to hazards. Tara has an interdisciplinary background in engineering, ecological science, and social science. Before starting her PhD, Tara worked as a water resource engineer in San Francisco Bay, a science communicator in Belize and Ireland, and a wilderness therapy instructor in Idaho. Tara earned her bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Santa Clara University and her master's in Human-Environment Systems from Boise State University."
