# LibAnswers Chat Widgets

Widgets are created and configured in LibAnswers > LibChat > Chat Widgets.

These are actively deployed (as titled on Chat Widgets page):

- "chat-page" (on `/help/chat.html`)
- "Proactive Widget Floating" (on /find/, articles, books, journals, etc)
- "Primo Widget" (on Primo)

When making updates to the offline message, etc, please try to keep these all in sync. 
They are each a bit different use case, but most of the text updates should apply to all. 

Since Chat is currently 24/7 coop, Ask Us and other links point to `/help/chat.html` (rather than using a separate widget, as in earlier versions).

To add proactive chat to a page, use the the front matter: 
`chat-widget: true`
