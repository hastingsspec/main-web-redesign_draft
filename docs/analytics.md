## Cross domain tracking

Fairly easy to set up using gtag. 
We just have to provide a list of all domains we want to track across, can use same snippet on all pages and domains.

## Enhanced link attribution 

is enabled. 
Uses ID of link or nearby parent to specify which link (of all the same href on a page) was actually clicked.
