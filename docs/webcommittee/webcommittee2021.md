### Spring 2021 Updates / Projects Review

Major projects:

- 24/7 Chat - Jessica and Evan update language and [widgets](https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/blob/main/docs/chat-widgets.md) all over to roll out new service. Also visible on mobile now.

New content:

- SPEC Chat - Robert and Evan add new proactive chat widget linked to SPEC specific chat service.
- [Prospective Students](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/visit.html) page - idea from Perri, Diane, Sarah, Hanwen, and others. Potential of "thick border" cards?
- [SPEC book collections list](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/books.html) - data from Amy
- [HBR policy](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/reserve/hbr.html) - interesting case of "we just need this info posted to the web somewhere"!
- [DataHub placeholder](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/datahub/) - coming soon!
- Lots of updates, fixes, and edits - thanks to Jylisa, Michelle, Kit, Bruce, Robert, Courtney, Amy, Hanwen, Shelley, and others! (check [contributors graph](https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/graphs/contributors?from=2020-04-02&to=2021-05-12&type=c))
- [How to Contribute doc](https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/blob/main/docs/contributing.md) draft

Under the hood updates:

- Migrate git branches from "master" to "main"
- Chat widget updates
- Updated assets / dependencies
- Cleaning up data files and Google Drive Sheets
- More content cleaned and moved to Markdown 

Analytics notes:

- 04-01-2020 - 04-01-2021 vs 04-01-2019 - 04-01-2020: slight increase in views (+8%, 1,170,190) and larger increase in users (+35%, 238,317).
    - multiple year trend since redesign sees large increase in users paired with slight decrease in views, pages/session, and session duration.
    - desktop users creeping down (69% -> 62%), mobile up (27% -> 35%), tablets down (3% -> 2.5%). Follows longer trend (four years ago mobile users were only 15%).
- Fun stuff:
    - Apr 21 - May 1 2021 --> 270,866% increase in Android users from Indonesia...
    - Jan 31 2021 --> "bottraffic" hit everyone around the world, sends us 10,000 views... 
    - T. Abraham [Repositories of Primary Sources](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/t-abraham/Other.Repositories.html) continues to be a top page, spiking in fall semester. Why???

        - can we have a short hand way to add territory to address area, then link to full acknowledgement page? (people like this idea)
        - One example: "(pin drop emoji) On Duwamish, Suquamish, and Salish Lands"
        - do we need to acknowledge 48 extension campus lands?
            - list of extension campuses and pointer to native lands?

## Discussion, Ideas, Feedback

> Present: Wikle, Berge, Prorak, Dong, Martinez, Doney, Henrich, Attebury, Perret, and Williamson.

### Discussion

- 24/7 chat - seems to be working well. External people seem to be able to find information. 
    - Jessica: after doing chat for other libraries--> appreciate information on our site!
- [Clean up Opening Guide?](https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/issues/474)
    - Keep updates page and nav link?
        - yes--place to highlight newsy info
        - database trials, alerts, exhibits (something that should last longer than a tweet)
    - COVID info pages - timeline for transitioning out of nav.
        - access details shaping up in next couple weeks (Kristin) 
        - Doesn't need to be front and center, doesn't need to be so extensive
    - off-campus access 
        - off-campus access info vs. distance education section and other info in site. Helpful to have all in one place. "distance education" might be dated language.
        - "distance education" libguide has some unique information about mailing materials?
        - add info about off-campus
        - add nav "off campus" access
    - "Library Resources to Pass the Time" --> find fun stuff page?
        - Diane + Rochelle
        - curate section info and resources, "pleasure reading", etc
- Transformative publishing agreement page (Jylissa and Jessica)

----------

## Summer Sprint Meetings

Each sprint meeting is intended to be a short, focused session looking at a specific topic on the library website. 
Hopefully this will provide opportunity to gather ideas, feedback, and move some projects forward. 
Feel free to join any that interest you!

### Profiles

> July 8, 1:30pm

Enhance, rethink directory pages -- the website has contact information with library folks in a wide variety of forms, how can we streamline and clarify this to get users to contacts they need quickly. Explore possibility of faculty profile pages (mirroring main UofI site), normalized titles, pronouns, and pronunciation helpers.

- CV link?
- office
- liaisons to services? yes in server nav
- directory by department
- divide by faculty staff vs deparment? --> by department
- pronouns - inline with name, small font, in ()
- pronoucation helper
- explore meta tags for contacts

- index of people by department
- departments page - to data?
- options for recording voice - windows "voice recorder"

Examples: 

- https://www.uidaho.edu/class/music/faculty/music-education

### Workshop Resources Enhance

> July 15, 1:30pm

Enhance workshop resources pages -- now that we have *a lot* of content on the workshop resources page, how can we make it more useable, better highlight video tutorials, and potentially connect with Instruction pages and curated Guides? 

- Workshop resources enhancements, https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/issues/455
- Topics of instruction suggest something new, https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/issues/469

- label "Resources" does that make sense?
    - "training", "materials"
- types of resources
    - video, playlist, session recording, website, slides, handouts
    - record for series? GSE
    - do we want to include curated Guides?
    - categories / subjects / tags? (GSE?) --> match up to Topics of Instruction
    - include external training sources (endnote, WoS, ArcGIS)  
        - helpful to curate, but maybe better some where else?
- randomize display?
- should profile pages pull in listings of resources?

- profiles link to workshop resources and topics of instructions
- suggestion something new, different form, pretty open ended
- dropdown on topics of instruction, too long complicated
