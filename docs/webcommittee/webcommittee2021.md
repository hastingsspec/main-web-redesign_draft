### Spring 2021 Updates / Projects Review

Major projects:

- 24/7 Chat - Jessica and Evan update language and [widgets](https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/blob/main/docs/chat-widgets.md) all over to roll out new service. Also visible on mobile now.

New content:

- SPEC Chat - Robert and Evan add new proactive chat widget linked to SPEC specific chat service.
- [Prospective Students](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/visit.html) page - idea from Peri, Diane, Sarah, Hanwen, and others. Potential of "thick border" cards?
- [SPEC book collections list](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/books.html) - data from Amy
- [HBR policy](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/reserve/hbr.html) - interesting case of "we just need this info posted to the web somewhere"!
- [DataHub placeholder](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/datahub/) - coming soon!
- Lots of updates, fixes, and edits - thanks to Jylisa, Michelle, Kit, Bruce, Robert, Courtney, Amy, Hanwen, Shelley, and others! (check [contributors graph](https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/graphs/contributors?from=2020-04-02&to=2021-05-12&type=c))
- [How to Contribute doc](https://github.com/uidaholib/main-web-redesign_draft/blob/main/docs/contributing.md) draft

Under the hood updates:

- Migrate git branches from "master" to "main"
- Chat widget updates
- Updated assets / dependencies
- Cleaning up data files and Google Drive Sheets
- More content cleaned and moved to Markdown 

Analytics notes:

- 04-01-2020 - 04-01-2021 vs 04-01-2019 - 04-01-2020: slight increase in views (+8%, 1,170,190) and larger increase in users (+35%, 238,317).
    - multiple year trend since redesign sees large increase in users paired with slight decrease in views, pages/session, and session duration.
- Fun stuff:
    - Apr 21 - May 1 2021 --> 270,866% increase in Android users from Indonesia...
    - Jan 31 2021 --> "bottraffic" hit everyone around the world, sends us 10,000 views... 
    - T. Abraham [Repositories of Primary Sources](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/t-abraham/Other.Repositories.html) continues to be a top page, spiking in fall semester. Why???
