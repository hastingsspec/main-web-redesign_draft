## Fall 2020 Updates

Major projects:

- SPEC Redesign, https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/
    - History: SPEC is probably the oldest section of the site, going back to early web work of [Terry Abraham](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/t-abraham/), so was a deep maze of content.
    - Process: SPEC + DDS sprint Aug 2020 to redesign all SPEC content
        - Intensive process of concentrated work and communication for two weeks. 
        - Morning and afternoon meeting each day. 
        - Everyone contributing in different ways with content creation/editing, populating spreadsheets, describing resources, setting up forms, researching topics, re-organization of content.
    - archive [Aug 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200813195112/https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/), [Oct 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201022085608/https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/)
    - Tons of new content and discovery features!
    - Contributions from Michelle, Courtney, Amy, Robert, and Kit.
- Harvester Blog, https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/
    - History: long running SPEC Tumblr blog with hundreds of posts, represents important content, research, and institutional knowledge --> idea to reclaim content and memory hosted on 3rd party platform to make it more searchable, preservable, and better linked to our collections.
    - major project by SPEC and Devin
    - migrated old content from Tumblr 
    - new blog content and collection 
    - new "collection" --> idea to store unique media to make it discoverable and reuseable, by either linking directly to current digital collections or new blog collection
    - able to pull in content from digital collections for composition

New content:

- [Proxy 404](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/proxy404.html) due to proxy migration

- Launch of [Instruction by Topic page](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/instruction/topics.html) (Marco, Devin, liaisons, Olivia, Evan)
- [Vandal Family Photo Album](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/vfpa/)
- Updated [My Library Stories](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/mylibrary/)
- [Floor map updates](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/maps.html) and [Virtual Tour](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/tour.html) (H5P Hanwen, Perri)
