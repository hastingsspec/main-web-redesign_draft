## Discussion

> Present: Rami, Robert, Olivia, Kevin, Kit, Hanwen, Courtney, Michelle, Diane, Evan.

- Increase body text size (like 1.2em in digital collections) - Group: yes do it!
- What to do with alerts going forward? How long keep them up? Reorganize to "new normal" (are they alerts any more)? 
    - Discussion: 
        - students are coming back from being away, need alerts. Something like "check our hours before you assume something is open"
        - need to regularly update alert type so people don't learn to ignore
        - alert topics could gradually move to carousel slides
        - Hours page should be updated to what ever they actually are in the fall (don't hold on to old hours as if they will revert back soon)
        - Possible Covid impact/actions as news updates? Record of actions taken
    - Actions:
        - slim down home page alerts
        - curbside delivery to a carousel slide 
        - explore new button to access latest covid-19 info page 
            - options: left of Ask Us, in topbar, in nav bar "covid-19"? 
        - move towards using COVID-19 "impact.html" page vs. current index.html, add some buttons to make it more functionally usable and highlight questions. 
- "Acting Against Racism"
    - Action: home page Alert should move to carousel slide --> Push to Ben and Cindy to figure out content.

    - https://www.wocintechchat.com/
    - Action: Follow up on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force work. Need review of site, create guidelines? Look for opportunities to do better.

Longer term projects: 

- Review: find errors, out-of-date info (email Olivia and Evan)
- Organize: longer term project to disambiguate categories/content, weed. 
- Contribute: Get more people integrated into website editing
    - move html content stubs into markdown
