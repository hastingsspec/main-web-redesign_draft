1. Using GitHub Desktop, change your current repoistory to "main-web-redesign_draft"
2. Click the Fetch Origin button to make sure the repository is up to date
3. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code. 
    (you can do this by clicking 'CTRL Shift A' or via the "Repository" menu at the top of GitHub Desktop -- the penultimate option should be "Open in Visual Studio Code")
4. Edit the content you'd like to change    
    All pages are contained in the /content/ folder and listed in folders corresponding to their respective areas
5. Save your changes. 
6. Open the terminal and type "jekyll s"
7. Use the link generated (probably - http://127.0.0.1:4000/) to check your changes 
8. If you're adding a page and want to adjust a menu to include it, you'll need to edit "pagesnav.yml" which is in the /_data/ directory
    Use the document to determine where to put your new page listing. Each section with its own menu has a section in this document. 
    Copy and paste and then replace the information appropriately. 
9. Save all your work and check the site one last time
10. Click on the terminal and click 'CTRL C' to stop the server
11. You should get a prompt in the terminal after doing this. 
12. Type "rake deploy"
13. Wait for the site to build. 
14. Open up the /_site/ directory in the Explorer (or finder) -- note: this will look gray in your VS Code because it does not get tracked by GitHub    
    This is where Jekyll builds the actual HTML pages
15. Copy the file(s) that you've added or changed (if there are a lot in one folder, you can just copy that folder. )
16. Open up the web site in your Explorer (something like: W:\www-lib-uidaho-edu\Content)
17. Find where your files should be placed, and paste them into that folder.
18. Replace files if you're editing an existing page. 
19. Go back to GitHub Desktop and commit and push all your changes!
