Join us at the Kenworthy Theatre in April for the launch of the [Main Street Video project](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/mainstreet/), an oral history exploration of the last video store in Moscow!

The Moscow Film Society and University of Idaho Library will present the *Main Street Video Staff Picks* series, featuring three films that reflect the video store’s iconic employee-curated shelf:

- [The Thing, April 10th at 7pm](https://www.kenworthy.org/events-calendar/the-thing/)
- [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, April 17th at 7pm](https://www.kenworthy.org/events-calendar/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind/)
- [Office Space, April 24th at 7pm](https://www.kenworthy.org/events-calendar/office-space/)

Be sure to visit the new [Main Street Video digital collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/mainstreet/) to explore the oral histories and essays!
