The University of Idaho Library and Elsevier publishing have reached an agreement to bring back access to over 2300 academic journals, effective immediately. 
This five-year agreement restores access to all content lost at the end of 2019 when budget cuts necessitated significant cancellations. 
Additionally, this new contract includes open access provisions that secure a discount on article processing charges for U of I authors who wish to make their work open access.

This investment in our researchers and our students is an important step toward the university's goal of reaching R1 research classification, and does so without requiring additional funding for the Library's collections budget.

All content can be found by searching the Library's catalog at <https://search.lib.uidaho.edu>. 
For more information, please contact Ben Hunter, Dean of University Libraries, at <bhunter@uidaho.edu>.
