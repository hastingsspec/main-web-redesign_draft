The newly released [Other Faces, Other Lives digital collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/otherfaces/) features materials produced for *Other Faces, Other Lives: Asian Americans in Idaho*, an oral history project that interviewed Asian American families in 1987-1990 about their lives and experiences in Idaho. The online collection contains the [full documentary film](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/otherfaces/items/otherfaces040.html), a variety of oral history recordings, video excerpts, and documents relating the production.

The original project was sponsored by the Palouse Asian American Association of Moscow/Pullman and a grant from the Ethnic Heritage Committee of the Idaho Centennial Commission in 1987. The interviews cover how their families moved to Idaho, their experiences of being Asian Americans in Idaho, if they faced discrimination or prejudice, questions regarding their cultural identities, and changes they see to the Asian American experience in Idaho.

Support for the digitization of these interviews was provided by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) through the Recordings at Risk program. The University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives received a grant through this program to support the project *Unheard Voices: Digitizing the Oral Histories of Underrepresented Communities in Idaho*.
