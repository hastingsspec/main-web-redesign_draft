[Think Open Fellowships](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/open/fellowship/) at the University of Idaho library support faculty and graduate teaching assistants who convert an upcoming U of I course to use open or otherwise zero cost course materials. This program is estimated to have saved Vandals more than $500,000 in textbook costs since 2017! [Previous fellows](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/open/fellowship/fellows.html) have created new interactive open textbooks, used existing public domain or open textbooks, and worked with the library to develop custom assignments and open educational resources. Fellows receive a $1,200 award, a letter of support for promotion and tenure, and ongoing support from the library.
