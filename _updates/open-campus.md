Since early 2023, the Open Campus Committee has been focused on an exciting new development that promises to help students make informed choices about their class materials costs. Course materials cost marking is the practice of applying a label or other easily identifiable and searchable facet to classes listed in the class schedule. Starting Summer 2024, students will be able to easily browse Zero and Very Low Cost ($30 or less) classes in the class schedule. 

In addition to being an important part of the State Board of Education’s requirements as set forth in [2021’s Instructional Materials Access and Affordability Policy](https://boardofed.idaho.gov/board-policies-rules/board-policies/higher-education-affairs-section-iii/iii-u-instructional-materials-access-and-affordability/), we are excited for how course marking can help make college costs more affordable and transparent for our Vandals. According to a 2023 study conducted here at the University of Idaho, 60% of undergraduates reported difficulty affording basic living expenses and 47% reported not purchasing a required text because they could not afford it. In national research, open materials have been shown to improve drop, fail, and withdraw rates, with particular benefits noted for Pell Grant and first generation students. 

The Library has developed several new digital tools to support faculty in utilizing the new course cost marking system:

- The [course cost checking tool](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/instruction/cost-labeling-tool/) is an interactive website that can help you determine if your materials qualify for the Zero or Very Low Cost labels
- The [Open at the University of Idaho pressbook](https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/OpenatUIdaho/) lays out on overall view of the open programs and activity supported on campus by the library
- A [FAQ](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/open/course-marking.html) with commonly asked questions
- Workflows and guidance for course schedulers

We are very pleased to announce that University of Idaho’s very first Zero and Very Low Cost courses are now marked in the course schedule for summer and fall 2024! If you think your class might be eligible, reach out to your department scheduler or contact Open Education Librarian [Marco Seiferle-Valencia](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/marcosv.html) at <marcsosv@uidaho.edu> for more information.
