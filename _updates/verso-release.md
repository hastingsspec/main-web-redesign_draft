The University of Idaho Library is excited to announce the launch of [**VERSO (Vandal Expertise, Research, and Scholarship Online)**](http://verso.uidaho.edu), a cutting-edge research information management (RIM) system and institutional repository (IR) designed to preserve and promote the university's research and creative output. Built on the powerful Esploro platform by Clarivate, VERSO will serve as the go-to hub for showcasing the expertise of faculty, students, and staff at the University of Idaho.

VERSO offers a seamless way for the University of Idaho community to manage, share, and promote their scholarly and creative works. As a comprehensive RIM system, it collects, preserves, and publishes data on research outputs, honors, grants, and more. By integrating with trusted academic sources and platforms like ORCID and Google Scholar, VERSO ensures that work produced at the University of Idaho reaches a global audience and is easily discoverable.

**Key Benefits of VERSO:**

* **Increased Visibility:** VERSO makes research and creative projects more accessible and searchable online, enhancing their visibility.  
* **Automated Updates:** Integrating with external platforms like ORCID and Clarivate's extensive data index, VERSO automates research output updates and streamlines profile management.  
* **Departmental Support:** VERSO provides analytics to promote department work and preserves research-related products, helping to prevent  data loss during faculty or student transitions.

"VERSO represents a major step forward in how we manage and promote the incredible work done at the University of Idaho," said Ben Hunter, Dean of the University of Idaho Library. "By leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Esploro platform, we are not only preserving our research but also ensuring it has the widest possible impact."

VERSO replaces the University's former system, VIVO, which had been maintained and updated by the Library since 2013\. Initial funding for the platform was provided by the Library and the Office of Research and Economic Development. 

VERSO is now live and available at [verso.uidaho.edu](https://verso.uidaho.edu/esploro/). Researchers can log in with their Vandal credentials to access or update their profiles.
