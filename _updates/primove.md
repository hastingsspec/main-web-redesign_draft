title: "Catalog Updated: Primo VE Launch"

Deep behind the scenes, the library's online service platform has migrated to an updated version, Primo VE, providing better integration for our digital systems and resources.
For most users there should be no change in your experience using our [catalog](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID).

**However, a lot of links have changed!**

The catalog's domain has changed from "alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com" to "alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com", and a number of link parameters are different.
All links on the library's website are updated.
*Please update your bookmarks and permalinks.*

If you encounter issues or discover broken links, please don't hesitate to contact us via [chat]({{ '/help/chat.html' | relative_url }}) or <libref@uidaho.edu>!
