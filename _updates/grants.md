The U of I Library received two $250,000 National Leadership Grants this month from the [Institute for Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/). 
The awards will support further development of two software projects: 
[JournalMap](https://journalmap.org/), a scientific literature search engine that uses environmental context to find papers that share a similar context;
and [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), a static web framework used around the world to build interactive digital exhibits.
