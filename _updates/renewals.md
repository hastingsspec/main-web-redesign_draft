title: Renewal Policy Update
date: 2022-01-10

Our renewal policy has been updated to better ensure equal opportunity to use the library's physical items for the entire U of I community:

- Checked out items may be renewed twice upon request, then must be physically returned to the Circulation Desk to be checked in.
- If the item is not otherwise requested or recalled, then it may be checked out again.
