In 2015 Lumen Learning visited Idaho campuses to help people adopt OER for the classroom.
However, Lumen recently [sold the majority of their community maintained OER to Course Hero](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2022-07-11-course-hero-quietly-took-over-hosting-lumen-s-oer-content-they-say-it-s-no-big-deal), redirecting the links to the course content without warning.
This may negatively impact some U of I faculty who created or use OER that was hosted on Lumen's platform. 

If you have been impacted by this issue or encounter links unexpectedly redirecting to Course Hero, please contact Open Education Librarian Marco Seiferle-Valencia (<marcosv@uidaho.edu>).
We may be able to migrate the OER to the [Library's Pressbooks instance](https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/) or find other solutions.
