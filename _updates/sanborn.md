The [Idaho Sanborn Maps](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/sanborn/) is the latest digital collection from the U of I Library Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning. It consists of 198 fire insurance maps covering 81 Idaho towns and cities created by the Sanborn Map Company from the 1880s to 1920s. Each map contains detailed information, including building materials, dimensions, construction type, property boundaries and locations of windows and doors. Initially produced by the company to assess liability, the maps are now housed in Special Collections and Archives and are a rich resource of historical data.
