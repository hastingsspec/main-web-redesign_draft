Uncover Idaho wilderness history in the newly published [Cougar Dave Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/cougar-dave/)! The collection documents the life of animal hunter David Lewis (i.e. Cougar Dave) in photographs, documents and audio. As Lewis’ former property is now home to University of Idaho’s Taylor Wilderness Research Center, the collection serves as an invaluable resource for understanding the region’s zoological and ecological development.
