Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) is a way of providing digital access to books that are currently available only in a physical format to increase accessibility of course texts to online and distance students. 
By creating a digital surrogate of physical items, we can ["loan legally acquired physical materials in a digital format under controlled conditions"](https://controlleddigitallending.org/illstatement).

The library has been piloting CDL this spring and will continue to offer this option through our Reserves services in the future.
