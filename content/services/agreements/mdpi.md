In 2024, the U of I Library joined the MDPI Institutional Open Access Program (IOAP).

## Benefits for U of I affiliates:

- MDPI publishes over 440 open access journals, 431 of which are peer-reviewed, and 98 that are ranked as high impact within their fields.
- For any manuscript where at least one author is an affiliated author, MDPI will grant a 10% reduction on the published APC (article processing charge) for the journal. 

## Requirements:

- To qualify for the 10% discount through the MDPI Institutional Open Access Program, authors must be an employee of or hold a research position at the U of I. This includes staff, undergraduate and postgraduate students, those on temporary or permanent research contracts, lecturers, full professors, and those granted emeritus titles.  Those with a temporary status qualify as affiliated authors if the research in the manuscript was partially or wholly conducted at the U of I. Affiliated authors must include the institutional address in their affiliation listed on the manuscript and be authorized to do so by the U of I.
