## FAQs

*Why is RSC Advances a separate OA APC?*

RSC Advances is a separate eJournal because at first it was a hybrid eJournal(2013-2016). Then in 2017, it was flipped to OA and it was given a lower APC charge then the remaining Gold OA titles.


*What is difference between hybrid and gold?*

Hybrid eJournals are a subscription journal in which some of the articles are OA. Publishing OA within a hybrid eJournal requires an OA APC. All publications in Gold OA eJournals are freely available. Publishing within Gold OA requires an OA APC as well. The APC allowance allows prospective authors to publish in any of our 44 eJournals.
