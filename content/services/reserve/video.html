<p>The University of Idaho Library has access to two streaming video platforms with content that can be used in the classroom or assigned to students:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://digitalcampus.swankmp.net/unividaho295672/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swank Digital Campus</a> - unlimited access to the top 250 films in Swank Film Library (most popular titles based on bookings at universities and colleges around the United States).</li>
    <li><a href="http://ida.lib.uidaho.edu:2048/login?url=https://uidaho.kanopy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kanopy</a> - the library purchases access to films on demand from the Kanopy catalog, with licenses that last one year. Patrons will need to submit a request to the library in order to access new Kanopy videos. Requests can be submitted via the Kanopy website.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to view a streaming video from a provider other than Kanopy or Swank, or for more information please contact <a href="mailto:haire@uidaho.edu">Jodi Haire</a> or your <a href="{{ '/about/liaisons.html' | relative_url }}">subject liaison</a>.</p>
