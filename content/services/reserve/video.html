<p>The University of Idaho Library has access to two streaming video platforms with content that can be used in the classroom or assigned to students:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://video.alexanderstreet.com/channel/academic-video-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Video Online (AVON)</a> - featuring more than 70,000 titles in a wide variety of subject areas with curricular relevance, including documentaries, interviews, feature films, performances, news programs and newsreels, demonstrations, and raw footage. </li>
    <li><a href="https://digitalcampus.swankmp.net/unividaho295672/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swank Digital Campus</a> - unlimited access to the top 250 films in Swank Film Library (most popular titles based on bookings at universities and colleges around the United States).</li>
    <li><a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.kanopy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kanopy</a> - the library purchases access to films on demand from the Kanopy catalog, with licenses that last one year. Patrons will need to submit a request to the library in order to access new Kanopy videos. Requests can be submitted via the Kanopy website.</li>
</ul>
