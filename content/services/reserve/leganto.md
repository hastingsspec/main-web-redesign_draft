Leganto is the U of I Library's integrated course reserves platform that helps make course materials more accessible to students.
Embedded directly into your Canvas course and connected to the library's resources, Leganto allows instructors to easily create and customize reading lists, so that students can access all their course materials in one place.

Feedback from instructors shows that Leganto is intuitive to use with a low barrier to entry, and has significant benefits for teaching and learning.
These benefits include: 

- **Reduced workload for instructors**
    - Reading lists can be saved and reused across semesters 
    - Ability to create multiple reading lists in draft form allows instructors to work at their own pace 
    - Autonomy in developing, changing, updating, and saving course lists 
- **Improved student experience**
    - Centrally located course materials 
    - Affordable, equitable access to library-purchased materials 
    - Interactive platform increases student engagement 
- **Seamless library integration and support**
    - Add library subscriptions, open education resources, popular media, and multimedia 
    - Get expert support for help with copyright, accessibility, and other questions 
    - "Cite It" feature allows direct import for readings wherever, whenever 

## Getting Started

To get started using Leganto the library will need to activate your Canvas course--please follow the instructions below.

### 1. Let the library know your Course ID number

- From within your Canvas course, navigate to "Settings" and the "Course Details" tab. Your course ID number is in the SIS ID field. 

{% include feature/figure-lazyload.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/reserves/canvas1.png" alt="canvas course details screenshot" border=true %}

- Copy and paste the Course ID (in the example above, 202100_123LIB) and email it to <libreserve@uidaho.edu>.
- If you don't see a SIS ID number (common for Independent Study of Idaho classes), please contact CETL (<cetl@uidaho.edu>) to request one manually be assigned. Make sure to let them know your course name and code. 

### 2. Add the "Library Resource List" link to your Canvas content

In Canvas a resource list can be added as a [stand-alone Module](#{{ 'A. Add as stand-alone module' | slugify }}) or can be [added to an existing Module](#{{ 'B. Add to an existing module' | slugify }}). 

#### A. Add as stand-alone module

- Navigate to the "Modules"

{% include feature/figure-lazyload.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/reserves/canvas2.png" alt="canvas modules screenshot" border=true %}

- Click "Create a New Module" *or* click the "+ Module" button in upper right corner.

{% include feature/figure-lazyload.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/reserves/canvas3.png" alt="canvas new module screenshot" border=true %}

- You can title the Module anything you want.

{% include feature/figure-lazyload.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/reserves/canvas4.png" alt="canvas module title screenshot" border=true %}

- Once the module is created, click the "+" sign in the module's title bar.

{% include feature/figure-lazyload.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/reserves/canvas5.png" alt="canvas module plus sign screenshot" border=true %}

- Under the "Add" dropdown, select "External Tool."

{% include feature/figure-lazyload.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/reserves/canvas7.png" alt="canvas hidden view screenshot" border=true %}
