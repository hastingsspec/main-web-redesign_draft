The following guidelines apply to materials placed on reserve.

## Course reserves

- Faculty may place readings on reserve to supplement assigned readings for their courses. These readings must comply with provisions in the U.S. Copyright Act and FERPA. If the nature, scope, or extent of copying is judged to exceed the fair use principles of the Copyright Act, the library will work with the professor to find alternative arrangements.
- The library cannot place instructor editions or review copies of textbooks on reserve without publisher permission. This includes material labeled: Instructor’s Edition, Annotated Instructor’s Edition, Publisher’s Review Copy, Teacher’s Manual, Examination Edition or Review Copy.

## Loan periods

- 3 hours, 1 day, 3 day (determined by instructor) for print reserve
- 24 hours/day for electronic reserve

## Fines

- $2 per hour or partial hour for overdue items, maximum $20, for print reserve
- No fines for electronic reserve

## Access

- Visit the <a href="list.html">Course Reserve Listings</a> and look for your course by instructor, term, or subject.
- Click on the course name to view a list of all items on reserve.
- To access electronic reserve items, students will have to sign in using their NetID.

## Special Restrictions 

### Harvard Business Review Guidelines

Harvard Business Review has very strict licensing rules governing the use of their materials. 
The HBR [500 articles](http://www.ala.org/rusa/sites/ala.org.rusa/files/content/sections/brass/Harvardbusinessreview/HBR_EBSCO_500_List_2013.pdf) and HBR cases are not typically available via our library databases.
HBR requests that faculty wishing to use these articles for course reserves [register as an educator and set up an online coursepack for students](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/home/). 
HBR will then provide free digital desk copies to instructors as well as teaching notes for HBR cases. 

HBR articles are somewhat less restricted, but neither libraries nor instructors are permitted to direct link to these materials from Leganto or Canvas/BBLearn. 
Instead, students need to search for the articles themselves.
Our [Accessing Harvard Business Review](/services/reserve/hbr.html) page provides instructions for students that can be referenced in your reading lists.
