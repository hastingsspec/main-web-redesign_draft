*Note: Harvard Business Review has very strict licensing rules that prevent the library from providing direct links to their articles from our course reserves site.*
*This page provides instructions for students needing to access a Harvard Business Review article for course reserves.*

The library subscribes to some HBR resources in its databases, [Business Source Premier](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?site=bsi) or [ABI/INFORM Global](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/abiglobal?accountid=14551).   

You can search for HBR articles by title in the database.
Navigate to the database by using the "Databases A-Z" link under the search box on the library homepage. 

1. Follow the library link to [Business Source Premier](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?site=bsi) to ensure you are logged in with U of I credentials. 
2. Search for your article.<br>
