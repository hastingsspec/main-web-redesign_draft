## Physical and Online Reserves 

Fill out the online <a href="request.html">Request Form</a> or come to the library's circulation desk and ask for the reserves coordinator.
Reading lists may be sent separately as an [email attachment](mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu)

- Each item must be identified by a complete citation:
  - Author
  - Title
  - Item Title (if applicable)
  - Date of Publication (including month and year, if applicable)
  - Volume, issue, page numbers (if applicable)
- **We would prefer a copy of the title page for each item.**
- **Requests lacking any of this information will take longer to process, pending citation verification.**

### Appropriate types of materials for physical reserves

- Library books
- Personal books
- Journal articles
- Book chapter (single chapter or 10 percent, whichever is LESS)
- Test files, lecture notes, solution files as created by instructor
- Student papers, with written permission of student author
- DVDs

### Successive use

Materials can be used for one semester under provisions of the Fair Use sections of the copyright law.
Subsequent use requires that the library purchase rights to re-use the item.
In the event that these rights are denied or deemed to be beyond reasonable costs, the library will remove the item from reserve and contact the professor about securing different readings.

## Controlled Digital Lending

Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) is a way of providing digital access to books that are currently available only in a physical format, to increase accessibility of course texts to online and distance students. 
This service is designed for circumstances in which the library is unable to find a licensing option for an existing e-book or e-resource. 
By creating a digital surrogate of physical items, we can ["loan legally acquired physical materials in a digital format under controlled conditions"](https://controlleddigitallending.org/illstatement).

What this means for U of I instructors and students:

- CDL books are like print books, meaning only one person can use them at a time 
- If someone else is using the CDL book you need, sign up on the waitlist: you'll be notified when the item becomes available 
- To find your course's CDL books, visit the library's [Course Reserves page](https://alliance-uidaho.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01ALLIANCE_UID/searchlists) or use the Reading List link in Canvas 

### Request Process

- Instructors can contact <libreserve@uidaho.edu> to request CDL conversation; requests must be made 2 weeks prior to time of need **at minimum**, due to processing time required.
- Each request will be reviewed for compliance with copyright law and approved or denied accordingly.
- Each CDL book/item is only available for one course per term.
- Each course is restricted to no more than 2 books, totaling no more than 800 pages, as CDL.
- CDL is restricted to UI Library owned items; we cannot digitize personal copies.
  - If a physical copy is available for purchase, the library may be able to buy a physical copy for CDL digitization.

### Access Limitations

- CDL items are restricted to one user at a time.
- The default time limit that students may view a CDL item is 3 hours; instructors can request a custom time limit by emailing <libreserve@uidaho.edu>
- CDL books are like print books: only one person can use them at a time. If a CDL book is in use already, students will be prompted to sign up for a waitlist and emailed when the item becomes available.
- Once notification is sent, students have 15 minutes to claim their turn before they are bumped down and the next person on the list is notified.
- CDL items are restricted to online viewing only: they can't be downloaded or viewed offline.
