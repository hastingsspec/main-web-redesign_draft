## In-Library Reserves 

Fill out online <a href="request.html">Request Form</a> or come to the library's circulation desk and ask for the reserves desk.

- Please include all information on form.
- Reading lists may be sent separately as an <a href="mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu">email attachment</a>, but the professor will still need to supply copies of the source pages.
- Each item must be identified by a complete citation:
  - Author
  - Title
  - Item Title (if appropriate)
  - Date of Publication (including month and year, if appropriate)
  - Volume, issue, page numbers (if appropriate)
- **We would prefer a copy of the title page for each item.**
- **Requests lacking any of this information will take longer to process, pending citation verification.**
- During peak periods processing may take up to a week, so please plan accordingly.

### Appropriate types of materials for physical reserves

- Library books
- Personal books
- Journal articles
- Book chapter (single chapter or 10 percent, whichever is LESS)
- Test files, lecture notes, solution files as created by instructor
- Student papers, with written permission of student author
- DVDs

### Inappropriate

-  Multiple chapters from the same book
-  More than two articles from the same** issue** of a journal
- Materials not in compliance with the copyright law
-  Commercially produced workbooks or instruction manuals with answer keys, or similar products that are excluded from the principles of Fair Use as designated by copyright law
-  Student papers without written permission of the student author
-  Materials lacking bibliographic citations or copies of the title page
-  Materials borrowed from other libraries

### Successive use

Materials can be used for one semester under provisions of the Fair Use sections of the copyright law. Subsequent use requires that the library purchase rights to re-use the item. In the event that these rights are denied or deemed to be beyond reasonable costs, the library will remove the item from reserve and contact the professor about securing different readings.

## Controlled Digital Lending

Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) is a way of providing digital access to books that are currently available only in a physical format, to increase accessibility of course texts to online and distance students. 
That is, this service is designed for circumstances in which the library is unable to find a licensing option for an existing e-book or e-resource. 
By creating a digital surrogate of physical items, we can ["loan legally acquired physical materials in a digital format under controlled conditions"](https://controlleddigitallending.org/illstatement).

What this means for U of I instructors: 

- Each course may be allotted up to 2 books, equaling a total of no more than 800 pages, to be digitized as CDL items. 
- We can only provide a digitized or physical version of a book: not both at the same time. 

What this means for U of I students: 

- CDL books are like print books, meaning only one person can use them at a timeâ€”plan ahead 
- If someone else is using the CDL book you need, sign up on the waitlist: you'll be notified when the item becomes available 
- To find CDL books, visit the library's [Course Reserves page](https://alliance-uidaho.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/readinglist/searchlists) or use the Reading List link in Canvas 

### Request Process

- Instructors can contact <libreserve@uidaho.edu> to request CDL conversation; requests must be made 2 weeks prior to time of need at minimum, due to processing time required.
- Each request will be reviewed for compliance with copyright law and approved or denied accordingly.
- Each CDL book/item is only available for one course per term.
- Each course is restricted to no more than 2 books, totaling no more than 800 pages, as CDL.
- CDL is restricted to UI Library owned items; we cannot digitize personal copies.
  - If a physical copy is available for purchase, the library may be able to buy a physical copy for CDL digitization.

### Access Limitations

- CDL items are restricted to one concurrent user at a time.
- The default time limit that students may view a CDL item is 3 hours; instructors can request a custom time limit by emailing <libreserve@uidaho.edu>
- CDL books are like print books: only one person can use them at a time. If a CDL book is in use already, students will be prompted to sign up for a waitlist and emailed when the item becomes available.
- Once notification is sent, students have 15 minutes to claim their turn before they are bumped down and the next person on the list is notified.
- CDL items are restricted to online viewing only: they can't be downloaded or viewed offline.

#### Appropriate types of materials for electronic reserves

- Full text articles (or links) from electronic journals or aggregators licensed by the University of Idaho Library
- Original materials created by the instructor where the instructor owns the copyright (test files, lecture notes, solutions files, syllabi)
- Book chapter (single chapter or 10 percent, whichever is LESS)
- Journal article
- Student papers with written permission of the student author
- Links to websites with materials that are covered under copyright law
- [Streaming video]({{ '/find/video.html' | relative_url }}) licensed by the Library

#### Inappropriate

- Multiple chapters from the same book
- More than two articles from the same issue of a journal
- Materials not in compliance with the copyright law
- Commercially produced workbooks or instruction manuals with answer keys, or similar products that are excluded from the principles of Fair Use as designated by copyright law
- Student papers without written permission of the student author
- Links to websites that post materials that are not in compliance with the copyright law
- Materials lacking bibliographic citations or copies of the title page

#### Submitting materials in electronic format

- PDF files acceptable
- File size is important: reduce size by scanning from clean copy (original preferred)
- Complete bibliographic citation (author, title, vol., no., mo., yr, pp.) required for copyright compliance
- Send to: <libreserve@uidaho.edu>

#### Submitting materials for scanning

- Original copy is preferred or clean, single-sided copies (no marks, lines) to avoid large file size
- Supply a copy of the title page and the verso of the title page, required for copyright compliance.
- Please drop off materials at the main U of I Library Circulation Desk.

#### Successive Use

Materials can be used for one semester under provisions of the Fair Use sections of the copyright law. Subsequent use requires that the library purchase rights to re-use the item. In the event that these rights are denied or deemed to be beyond reasonable costs, the library will remove the item from reserve and contact the professor about securing different readings.

#### Limits

5 articles per week may be submitted for scanning. More than this will be scanned as time permits. If no priorities are indicated, library staff will use its discretion to avoid further delays.

#### Processing Time

- Typically, first come, first served; may, at the discretion of the library, be arranged to serve the largest number of students for the least effort.
- Plan for two weeks, particularly if you expect the library to scan and/or pull materials.
- Remember that everyone needs to have their materials available for the first day of the semester. Do not expect this to happen if you have not submitted your material two weeks before the first day of the semester.
- You will be notified by email when your material is available. At this time, you will be given the password for your students to use to gain access to scanned documents.
