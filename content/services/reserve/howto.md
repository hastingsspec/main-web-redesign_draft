## In-Library Reserves 

Fill out online <a href="request.html">Request Form</a> or come to the library's circulation desk and ask for the reserves desk.

- Please include all information on form
- Reading lists may be sent separately as an <a href="mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu">email attachment</a>, but the professor will still need to supply copies of the source pages.
- Each item must be identified by a complete citation:
  - Author
  - Title
  - Item Title (if appropriate)
  - Date of Publication (including month and year, if appropriate)
  - Volume, issue, page numbers (if appropriate)
- **We would prefer a copy of the title page for each item**
- **Requests lacking any of this information will take longer to process, pending citation verification.**
- During peak periods processing may take up to a week, so please plan accordingly.

#### Appropriate types of materials for physical reserves

- Library books
- Personal books
- Journal articles
- Book chapter (single chapter or 10 percent, whichever is LESS)
- Test files, lecture notes, solution files as created by instructor
- Student papers, with written permission of student author

#### Inappropriate

-  Multiple chapters from the same book
-  More than two articles from the same** issue** of a journal
- Materials not in compliance with the copyright law
-  Commercially produced workbooks or instruction manuals with answer keys, or similar products that are excluded from the principles of Fair Use as designated by copyright law
-  Student papers without written permission of the student author
-  Materials lacking bibliographic citations or copies of the title page
-  Materials borrowed from other libraries

#### Successive use

Materials can be used for one semester under provisions of the Fair Use sections of the copyright law. Subsequent use requires that the library purchase rights to re-use the item. In the event that these rights are denied or deemed to be beyond reasonable costs, the library will remove the item from reserve and contact the professor about securing different readings.

#### Successive Use

Materials can be used for one semester under provisions of the Fair Use sections of the copyright law. Subsequent use requires that the library purchase rights to re-use the item. In the event that these rights are denied or deemed to be beyond reasonable costs, the library will remove the item from reserve and contact the professor about securing different readings.

#### Limits

5 articles per week may be submitted for scanning. More than this will be scanned as time permits. If no priorities are indicated, library staff will use its discretion to avoid further delays.

#### Processing Time

- Typically, first come, first served; may, at the discretion of the library, be arranged to serve the largest number of students for the least effort.
- Plan for two weeks, particularly if you expect the library to scan and/or pull materials.
- Remember that everyone needs to have his materials available for the first day of the semester. Do not expect this to happen if you have not submitted your material two weeks before the first day of the semester.
- You will be notified by email when your material is available. At this time, you will be given the password for your students to use to gain access to scanned documents.
- If you would like to check on the availability of your class, please visit the <a href="index.html">Reserve page</a> on our website.
