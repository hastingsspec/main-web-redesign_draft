Course Reserves are resources selected by instructors to support student learning. 
Reserve items have shorter loan periods to ensure all users have access to the resources. 
These items can be compiled into a single reading list accessible directly in Canvas via [Leganto]({{ '/services/reserve/leganto.html' | relative_url }}).

To make a reserves request, stop by the library and fill out a reserves request form, fill out the [online request form](https://uidaho.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d3UL6u0pxEGpZs2), or [email Reserves directly](mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu)

## Course reserves

- Instructors may place textbooks, videos, readings, and more on reserve for use by students in their course. The resulting reading list will be reused for following semesters for the same class and instructor unless otherwise requested.
- Students may request books or other resources that are used for coursework be placed on reserve.
- These resources must comply with provisions in the U.S. Copyright Act and FERPA. If the nature, scope, or extent of copying is judged to exceed the fair use principles of the Copyright Act, the library will work with the professor to find alternative arrangements.

## Loan periods

- 3 hours, 1 day, 3 day for print reserve. If instructor does not specify loan period, the default is 1 day.

## Fines

- $2 per hour for overdue items, maximum $20, for print reserve. Electronic resources have no fines or fees.

- ### Will the library buy resources for my course?
    - The library will consider purchasing **only*** mandatory resources for courses if they are not currently owned. Each purchase, from physical books to electronic resources like streaming videos and eBooks, will be decided on based on cost and availability. Purchase requests can be made through the [online request form](https://uidaho.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d3UL6u0pxEGpZs2) or by [emailing Reserves directly](mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu).
- ### How do I access materials from off-campus?
    - Check the [Accessing Library Resources Off-Campus](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/distance.html) guide.
- ### Can Harvard Business Review content be put on reserve?
    - No, they cannot be linked via Leganto or Canvas. Instructors must ensure that the Library has access to the desired article, and students must search for articles themselves.
- ### How do students find Harvard Business Review content?
    - Some HBR resources are available through the [Business Source Premier](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?site=bsi) and [ABI/INFORM Global](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/abiglobal?accountid=14551) databases. Students must be logged in to access full-text articles.
- ### When should I submit my requests and reading lists?
    - All submissions for course reserves, including for scanning and general reading list submission, should be sent to the Library as soon as possible, preferably before the semester of use.
- ### Where can I learn more about Leganto?
    - Contact reserves [via email](mailto:libreserve) or by stopping by the circulation desk. Questions about or issues with Canvas should be direct to the [Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL)](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/cetl/index.asp).

- ### Scanning: What are the requirements for scans?
    - Scans are required to be clean and run through OCR software. If scans are not suitable for use, they will need to be re-done by Library staff. Staff will be in contact if the original text is needed for re-scanning.
- ### Scanning: How quickly will scans be processed?
    Scanning will be done by order of receipt, within a week for articles/book chapters. Further information on Controlled Digital Lending scanning can be found in the CDL section of this FAQ.

- ### Copyright: What do I need to know about copyright with reserves?
    - Please [access our Copyright Guide](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/copyright/guide.html), and direct any questions to the [reserves email](libreserve@uidaho.edu), or [Kristin Henrich](mailto:khenrich@uidaho.edu), the Copyright and Open Scholarship Librarian.
- ### Copyright: Why do I need written permission to use students' work or any unpublished work that is not my own?
    - The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects any use of student papers without their written permission. You can use the [Library's Student Materials Permission Form](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/pdf/studentMaterialsPermission.pdf) to obtain this permission.

- ### Controlled Digital Lending: What is Controlled Digital Lending and how does it work for reserves?
    - Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) is a way of providing digital access to books that are currently available only in a physical format, when the library is unable to find a licensing option for an existing e-book or e-resource. Library-owned books are scanned fully by staff and added to our catalog for use in reserves. Requests for CDL can be denied at the discretion of Library staff.
- ### Controlled Digital Lending: How much can I ask to be scanned for CDL?
    - No more than 2 books for a total of no more than 800 pages can be requested for CDL by an instructor in a semester. Condition of the book and ability of staff may affect if books are able to be scanned.
- ### Controlled Digital Lending: How long will CDL scanning take?
    - Scanning will take **at least** two weeks. Due to the time it takes to scan CDL items, requests should be submitted as promptly as possible.
- ### Controlled Digital Lending: How do students access CDL items?
    - CDL scans will be available in the corresponding course reading list hosted on [Leganto](https://alliance-uidaho.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01ALLIANCE_UID/searchlists). Users must be logged in. Access is limited to one user for three hours; a waitlist is available if the resource is in use and users will be notified when it is available.
