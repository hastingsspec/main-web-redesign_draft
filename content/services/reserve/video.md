The University of Idaho Library has access to streaming video platforms with content that can be used in the classroom or assigned to students:

- <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://video.alexanderstreet.com/channel/academic-video-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Video Online (AVON)</a> - featuring more than 70,000 titles in a wide variety of subject areas with curricular relevance, including documentaries, interviews, feature films, performances, news programs and newsreels, demonstrations, and raw footage.
- <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.kanopy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kanopy</a> - the library purchases access to films on demand from the Kanopy catalog, with licenses that last one year. Patrons will need to submit a request to the library in order to access new Kanopy videos. Requests can be submitted via the Kanopy website.

If you need to view a streaming video from a provider other than AVON or Kanopy, or for more information please contact <a href="mailto:haire@uidaho.edu">Jodi Haire</a> or your <a href="{{ '/about/liaisons.html' | relative_url }}">subject liaison</a>.
