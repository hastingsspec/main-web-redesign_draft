		<p>Summit is a resource sharing service that provides access to print materials and media from 37 academic libraries throughout Oregon, Washington and Idaho. This service is available free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid UI account. Summit works hand-in-hand with your pre-existing circulation account, so no special registration is required.</p>

		<p>Summit utilizes a courier service that delivers materials within <b>3-5 business days</b>. This makes it a faster and less expensive alternative to Interlibrary Loan. This is why <b>Summit is our preferred method for requesting materials that the UI Library does not own</b>.</p>

						<p>Once the UI Library receives your requested Summit item, an automated email will be sent by the circulation desk alerting you to pick the material up. The email will also indicate which pickup location your item is available at.</p>
						<p>If you need to change the pickup location for a request that has already been submitted or has arrived, please contact Circulation at (208) 885-6559, or by email at <a href="mailto:libcircd@uidaho.edu">libcircd@uidaho.edu</a>.</p>
