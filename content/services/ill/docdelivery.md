Document Delivery provides electronic access to journal articles and book chapters from the U of I Library's print collection. 
This service is available free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid U of I account. 

Please check the UI Library's <a href="https://search.lib.uidaho.edu/">online catalog</a> for access to electronic journals and e-book collections prior to submitting a Document Delivery request. 
We may already have electronic access to the materials you need.

Document Delivery requests can be submitted through your <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll">ILLiad account</a>, just as you would any other article or book chapter request. 
You will receive an automated email notice once the item has been scanned and posted to your ILLiad account. 
Delivery time is approximately 24-48 hours. 

Document Delivery files remain accessible for *30 days* after you receive the email notification and then are automatically deleted. 
You can also remove articles earlier by using the Delete button.

## Digitization Requests

Alternatively, all patrons, including public patrons, may submit a digitization request via the library's catalog by clicking on "Digitization Request" from a record. 
Once processed, patrons will receive an email with a link to view their requested resource. 
Articles and book chapters will typically be available within 2 to 3 business days. 
Longer government publications and theses/dissertations may take 2 to 3 weeks to be digitized.

## Digitization Policies

The library invites you to place digitization requests for physical materials. 
However, all requests will be completed in compliance with [copyright and fair use guidelines](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/reserve/fairuse.html). 

While requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in general we will *not* be able to digitize: 

- More than one chapter from a book. 
- More than 10% of a resourceâ€™s total content. 
- More than one article from a journal issue. 
- The entirety of a picture book.

We will, however, often be able to digitize: 

- Older University of Idaho Theses and Dissertations that are not already digitized. 
- U.S. Government Publications. 
- Portions of physical reserve materials that are inaccessible due to library closures and/or other barriers resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Please contact ILL (<a href="mailto:libill@uidaho.edu">libill@uidaho.edu</a>) if you have questions about a request.
