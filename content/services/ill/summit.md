Summit is a resource sharing service that provides access to print materials and media from 37 academic libraries throughout Oregon, Washington and Idaho. 
This service is available free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid U of I account. 
Summit works hand-in-hand with your pre-existing circulation account, so no special registration is required.

Summit utilizes a courier service that delivers materials within **3-5 business days**. 
This makes it a faster and less expensive alternative to Interlibrary Loan. 
This is why **Summit is our preferred method for requesting materials that the U of I Library does not own**.

				<p>If you need to change the pickup location for a request that has already been submitted or has arrived, please contact Circulation at (208) 885-6559, or by email at <a href="mailto:libcirc@uidaho.edu">libcirc@uidaho.edu</a>.</p>
