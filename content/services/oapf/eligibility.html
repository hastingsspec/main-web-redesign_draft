      <li>Funding per article is capped at $2000.00.</li>

<h4 class="card-title mb-0">Author Criteria</h4>
</div>
<div class="card-body">

    <h5 id="authors">Authors</h5>

    <ul>
      <li>Current U of I faculty, staff, researchers, and enrolled students are eligible to apply for funds.</li>

      <li>Authors may apply for funding multiple times until their cap is met or funds are exhausted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For <strong>multi-authored works</strong> the article maximum ($2000.00) is prorated per U of I author and determined by dividing the article process charges (APCs) by the number of U of I authors.</p>

    <h5 id="external-funding">External Funding</h5>

    <p>We strongly encourage researchers to request funding for open access publications from their funding agency if they can do so. 
Authors with sufficient funding from grants or contracts are encouraged to use those funds to allow others to share in the benefit of open publications.</p>

    <p>Priority will be given to U of I - OAPF applications without other sources of funding available.</p>
