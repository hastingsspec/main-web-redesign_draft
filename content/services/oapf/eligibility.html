    <h4 class="card-title mb-0">Author Criteria</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">

    <h5 id="authors">Authors</h5>

      <li>Current U of I faculty, staff, researchers, and enrolled students are eligible to apply for the OAPF</li>
      <li>Funding per author is capped at $3000.00 per fiscal year</li>

      <h5 id="authors">Multi-Authored Works</h5>
    <p>For multi-authored works with more than one U of I author, the article maximum ($2000.00) is prorated by dividing the article processing charges (APCs) by the number of U of I authors.</p>

    <h5 id="external-funding">External Funding</h5>

    <p>We strongly encourage researchers to request funding for open access publications from their funding agency if they can do so.
      Authors with sufficient funding from grants or contracts are encouraged to use those funds to allow others to share in the benefit of open publications.</p>

    <p>Priority will be given to OAPF applications without other sources of funding available.</p>
