<h3 id="invoices-and-reimbursement">Invoices and Reimbursement</h3>

<p>The U of I - OAPF prefers to pay journals directly, thus minimizing out-of-pocket cost to the authors. Upon funding approval, the funded applicant will forward their invoice directly to the Library’s Administrative Financial Specialist (<a href="mailto:jmylan@uidaho.edu">Jennifer Mylan</a>) and the U of I OAPF - Fund Manager (<a href="mailto:jylisadoney@uidaho.edu">Jylisa Doney</a>), or direct the journal to do so.</p>

<p>However, in case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of payment. The U of I - OAPF will review other possible payment options as needed, e.g. paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers.</p>
