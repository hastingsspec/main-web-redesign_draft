<p>U of I - OAPF funding is contingent upon providing proper documentation to the U of I – OAPF Fund Manager and the Library’s Fiscal Officer. Proper documentation differs based on the preferred method of payment, as detailed below:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Option 1: U of I - OAPF pays the invoice
    <ul>
      <li>Official invoice with an issue date of July 1 (of the current FY) or later</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Option 2: U of I – OAPF reimburses applicant for out-of-pocket invoice payment
    <ul>
      <li>Official invoice with an issue date of July 1 (of the current FY) or later</li>
      <li>Receipt with a date of payment of July 1 (of the current FY) or later</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Invoices or receipts with issue dates that have been changed (including, but not limited to: reissued invoices, credit notes, etc.) do not meet the U of I – OAPF’s documentation requirements.</p>
    
  <p>The U of I - OAPF prefers to pay journals directly, thus minimizing out-of-pocket costs to the authors. However, in the case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of payment. Other possible payment options will be reviewed as needed, e.g. paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers.</p>-->
