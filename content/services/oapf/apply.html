  <li>U of I OAPF - Fund Manager will use a <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/oapf/RubricTemplate_UIOAPF.pdf">standard rubric</a> to evaluate application based on eligibility criteria and make funding decision</li>
  <li>U of I OAPF - Fund Manager will email applicants their funding decision and a copy of the rubric</li>
  <li>Funded applicants will forward their invoice for payment by the U of I - OAPF</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="invoices-and-reimbursement">Invoices and Reimbursement</h3>

<p>The U of I - OAPF prefers to pay journals directly, thus minimizing out-of-pocket cost to the authors. Upon funding approval, the funded applicant will forward their invoice directly to the Libraryâ€™s Administrative Financial Specialist and the U of I OAPF - Fund Manager (<a href="mailto:jylisadoney@uidaho.edu">Jylisa Doney</a>), or direct the journal to do so.</p>

<p>However, in case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of payment. The U of I - OAPF will review other possible payment options as needed, e.g. paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers.</p>
