U of I - OAPF funding is contingent upon providing proper documentation to the <a href="mailto:jylisadoney@uidaho.edu">U of I - OAPF Fund Manager</a> and the Library's Fiscal Officer. 
Documentation differs based on the preferred method of payment, as detailed below:
      
- Option 1: U of I - OAPF pays the invoice
  - Official invoice with an issue date between July 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 (funding period #1) or between January 1, 2023 and June 16, 2023 (funding period #2)
- Option 2: U of I - OAPF reimburses applicant for invoice payment
  - Official invoice with an issue date between July 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 (funding period #1) or between January 1, 2023 and June 16, 2023 (funding period #2)
  - Official receipt with a payment date between July 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 (funding period #1) or between January 1, 2023 and June 16, 2023 (funding period #2)

Invoices or receipts with issue dates or payment dates that have been changed (including, but not limited to: reissued invoices, credit notes, etc.) do not meet the U of I - OAPF's documentation requirements.
