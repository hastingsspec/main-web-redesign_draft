## Late Fees Discontinued

The library will no longer collect late fees or fines for items in our general collection as part of our <a href="{{ site.lib-media }}/about/library_strategic_plan_2021.pdf">commitment to equitable access to information and student affordability</a>.

Some items in the library, such as <a href="{{ '/services/reserve/policies.html' | relative_url }}">print Course Reserves</a> or U of I Multimedia equipment, are exceptions to this policy and will continue to accrue late fees. 
In addition, the library will continue assessing lost item fees to patrons. 

See [Borrowing Policies]({{ '/services/borrow/#fines' | relative_url }}) for more information.
