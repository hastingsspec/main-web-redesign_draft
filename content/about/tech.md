University of Idaho Library's website is built using modern static web technologies following the [lib-STATIC](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Our development stack is powered by open source tools and libraries, including [Jekyll static generator](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), [lightGallery](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/), and many others.
Project code is managed on GitHub.

Our site content is created using plain text files and data spreadsheets, which are rendered into the final web pages using modular template elements.
Everything is hosted on a basic server with no databases or server-side language, a simple and sustainable infrastructure that still provides high performance access using the static web approach.
The lib-STATIC methodology enables more agile and responsive development of our website, involving librarians at every level of design and deployment.

## Web Accessibility

The University of Idaho Library strives to make all of its online content accessible to all users. 
We carry out accessibility audits as part of our regular design process, using [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure) and other accessibility and performance audit services to assess our site in an ongoing manner. 

We are informed by the philosophy that accessibility is essential to useability which impacts the core mission of libraries to provide access to information. 
Any improvements we make to better structure and markup information are intended to positively impact access for all users, on all devices, and to enable preservation for future users. 

The simplicity of our static web approach lends to good accessibility and the ability to quickly fix issues. 

Here are some accessibility resources relevant to library websites that we use as guides for our development:

- [ARL Web Accessibility Toolkit: Standards & Best Practices](https://accessibility.arl.org/standards-best-practices/)
- [Useability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html)
- [Accessibility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/)
- [MDN Webdocs Docs: Handling common accessibility problems](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility)
