The University of Idaho "welcomes and respects all people. Diversity and inclusion are the core of our community and we embrace them as our guiding principles" (University of Idaho [Diversity and Inclusion Statement](https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity)). 

The University of Idaho Library affirms these values and is committed to actively welcoming, centering, and prioritizing diverse perspectives and experiences - including those from historically marginalized backgrounds - in our services, programs, spaces, and workforce.

University of Idaho Library personnel work to recognize the explicit and implicit biases which prevent us from providing the services, collections, programs, and safe spaces that reflect and promote the diverse environment that we strive to create. 
We individually and collectively take decisive action to engage in addressing and counteracting our personal and organizational biases.

The University of Idaho Library defines diversity, equity, and inclusion as the following:
- **Diversity**: The University of Idaho Library acknowledges and welcomes the presences of differences. 
We are committed to taking decisive actions to eliminate discrimination, marginalization, and exclusion based on differences in race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, ability, neurotype, religion, national origin, military status, height, weight, language, and political perspective.
- **Equity**: The University of Idaho Library takes decisive actions to ensure that all Library users have the tools, services, resources, and safe spaces they need to be successful, regardless of background, status, beliefs, or identity.
- **Inclusion**: The University of Idaho Library takes decisive actions to promote an inclusive, respectful, and safe environment by listening and responding to the needs of our Library users and Library personnel. 
We define inclusion as an environment where all members of our University and broader community - especially those from historically marginalized backgrounds - feel valued, respected, safe, and welcome.
