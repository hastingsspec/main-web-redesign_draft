      <h3 id="conduct" class="font-weight-bold">Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>The University of Idaho Libraries are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and productive learning environment. Library users are expected to treat each other, the facility, and the collections respectfully, and to abide by the <a href=" http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/fsh/2300.html">University of Idaho Student Code of Conduct</a>; violation of the code of conduct is subject to sanctions, including but not limited to revocation of library privileges.</p> 
   
    <h3 id="circulation" class="font-weight-bold">Circulation Policies</h3>
    <div>
      <h4 class="pl-2">Periodicals</h4>
      <p class="pl-4">Periodicals are designated as non-circulating, and in most cases must be used in the library. If
        a periodical needs
        to be taken out of the building for photocopying purposes a 24-hour circulation is possible. Circulation desk
        staff
        will check out the item. Librarian approval is necessary for longer periods. </p>
      <h4 class="pl-2">Maps</h4>
      <p class="pl-4">Maps must have an approval slip from a reference librarian to be checked out. The librarian will
        fill out the approval
        slip, including the due date and time. The patron will then be directed to the circulation desk with the
        approval
        slip, map and map tube. </p>
      <h4 class="pl-2">Reference Books</h4>
      <p class="pl-4">These items also must have an approval slip from a reference librarian. The librarian will fill
        out the approval slip,
        including due date and time, and send the patron with it and the reference book to the circulation desk.</p>
      <!--<h4>Videos from NIC and LCSC</h4>
                <p>NIC will only lend their videos to UI faculty, staff, and grad students. LCSC will lend their videos to all UI library users (including those with guest cards).</p>-->
      <h4 class="pl-2">Off-campus Faculty, Staff and Students</h4>
      <p class="pl-4">For UI, UI law, IMTC, Herbarium and Women's Center books: Find the book in the catalog, click on
        'find it', then 'sign
        in for more options'. After signing in, you may then request the UI owned item, or request the item via Summit,
        or
        request the item via ILL. Books are mailed to the patron's address. They must be returned by the due date using
        the
        enclosed mailing label.</p>
      <p class="pl-4">For Interlibrary Loan books: We mail books from other libraries to off-campus patrons who reside
        in Canada and the
        U.S. via first class mail. Due dates are determined by the lending library and average three weeks. One renewal
        may be possible. Books must be returned first class, FedEx or UPS by the due date. Overdue fees apply for all
        patrons.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="fines" class="font-weight-bold">Fines</h3>
    <div class="pl-4">
      <p>Fines are $0.30 a day up to a maximum of $10.50 per book. Lost books have a charge of $50.00 for the book and
        a $20.00
        processing fee. Recalled books are given a $20.00 fine.</p>
      <p>Fines for Reserve materials are $2.00 per hour or partial hour for overdue items, maximum $20.00, for paper
        reserve. There
        are no fines for electronic reserve materials.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="cellphone" class="font-weight-bold">Cell Phone Policy</h3>
    <div class="pl-4">
      <p>By working with you, members of the University of Idaho academic community, to better understand the issues
        before
        us, it is quite obvious that we all have different opinions about cell phones and their appropriateness in the
        Library.</p>
      <p>Given that we (University of Idaho community members) recognize:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>there is a need for quiet study in the library</li>
        <li>there will be no active enforcement by library staff of this policy</li>
        <li>that noise pollution should be reduced in this public place</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Library requests that cell phones and their users respect the wishes of the people who desire a quiet
        location
        for study by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>changing the setting on their phones to a non-audible signal</li>
        <li>limiting their conversations in public areas, particularly on the third and fourth floors</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Library further requests that all users honor the space on the third and fourth floors as quiet areas,
        taking conversations
        and group work either to group study rooms or to other spaces in the building.</p>
      <p>We hope that this policy is something we can accept as a behavior contract, and that this is liberal enough so
        the
        community can share in its enforcement. Thank you for your efforts in discussing this issue.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="foodanddrink" class="font-weight-bold">Food and Drink Policy</h3>
    <div class="pl-4">
      <p>This policy is designed to create a welcoming atmosphere for all library users. Food and drink pose a
        potential risk
        to library collections, equipment, and furnishings. We, therefore, ask that you act responsibly when consuming
        food
        and beverages in the library. The Library reserves the right to enforce this policy at its own discretion.
        Thank
        you for your kind cooperation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="reserve" class="font-weight-bold">Reserve Policy</h3>
    <div>
      <h4 class="pl-2">Course reserves</h4>
      <p class="pl-4">Faculty may place readings on reserve to supplement assigned readings for their courses. These
        readings must comply
        with provisions in the U.S. Copyright Act and FERPA. If the nature, scope, or extent of copying is judged to
        exceed
        the fair use principles of the Copyright Act, the library will work with the professor to find alternative
        arrangements.</p>
      <h4 class="pl-2">Loan periods</h4>
      <p class="pl-4">3 hour, 1 day, 3 day (determined by instructor) for paper reserve</p>
      <p class="pl-4">24 hours/day for electronic reserve</p>
      <h4 class="pl-2">Fines</h4>
      <p class="pl-4">$2 per hour or partial hour for overdue items, maximum $20.00, for paper reserve</p>
      <p class="pl-4">No fines for electronic reserve</p>
      <h4 class="pl-2">Access</h4>
      <p class="pl-4"> Visit the <a href="https://libguides.uidaho.edu/er.php?b=i">E-Reserves Listings</a> and look for
        your course by instructor, term, or subject.</p>
      <p class="pl-4">To access electronic reserve items, students will have to sign in using their NetID.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="groupstudyrooms" class="font-weight-bold">Library Group Study Room Policies</h3>
    <div class="pl-4">
      <p>First floor study rooms are available for reservation. If not currently occupied, they are first come, first
        serve
        with priority given to groups.</p>
      <p>Study rooms on other floors are not scheduled or reserved.</p>
      <p>Groups take precedence over individuals. A group of two or more has priority over one person who is waiting
        for others
        to arrive.</p>
      <p>Groups may not "camp out" for extended periods.</p>
      <p>Windows and doors must remain uncovered and unobstructed.</p>
      <p>Lights are to be left on.</p>
      <p>Rooms are not available during the summer.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="lockerscarrels" class="font-weight-bold">Study Lockers and Carrels</h3>
    <div class="pl-4">
      <p>Study lockers are available to all UI students on a first come, first served basis. The lockers are assigned
        for one
        semester only. The assignment may be renewed if there is no waiting list. A $3.00 key deposit is collected when
        a
        key is issued and refunded when the key is returned.
        <a href="http://lib.uidaho.edu/pdf/lockerapp.pdf">Locker applications are available online</a> and at the
        Circulation Desk.</p>
      <p>Study carrels are available to UI graduate students who have an approved thesis or dissertation topic and who
        do not
        have an assigned office, desk or carrel elsewhere on campus. Carrels are assigned on a first come, first served
        basis,
        for one semester only. The assignment may be renewed if there is no waiting list. A $10.00 key deposit is
        collected
        when a key is issued and refunded when the key is returned.
        <a href="http://lib.uidaho.edu/pdf/carrelapp.pdf">Carrel applications are available online</a> and at the
        Circulation Desk.</p>
      <p>Students assigned to a locker or carrel must abide by all library rules regarding food, drink, and conduct,
        and may not use lockers or carrels to store items that could be hazardous or detrimental to other patrons or
        the collections. Any food items kept in the locker or carrel must be stored in sealed containers. All items
        must fit within the locker or carrel provided, and library items kept within lockers or carrels must be checked
        out to the assigned student. </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="scanning" class="font-weight-bold">Scanning Requests</h3>
    <div class="pl-4">
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/">Digital Initiatives</a> is happy to provide high resolution scans
        of maps, photographs, or other items to patrons.
        The charge is $8.00 per scan (note that large objects, such as maps, will cost extra due to the extra scans
        needed to
        complete the process). The patron should leave the item with a reference librarian and then email
        dbecker@uidaho.edu
        his/her name, physical address (for tax purposes), email address, and a link for the item (if available). We
        will
        scan the item and send the patron a link to the file, as well as an invoice for the charge. The patron should
        expect
        to receive the scan in 5-7 days. </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="collmanage" class="font-weight-bold">Collection Management</h3>
