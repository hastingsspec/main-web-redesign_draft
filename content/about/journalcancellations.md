Due to a combination of university-wide budget reductions and unsustainable [journal inflation costs](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/review/index.html#faq), the University of Idaho Library has had to significantly reduce our journal subscriptions. These cuts have been wide-ranging and include a substantial reduction to our [Elsevier ScienceDirect contract](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/elsevier.html).

Though we do not expect to see journal funding restored to previous levels, the U of I Library will be continually reviewing all subscriptions and reinvesting in high-demand journals. We will be reviewing a number of data points to make these determinations including turn-away metrics (i.e., journals that U of I users try to access but are not able to), interlibrary loan requests, and [feedback from users](https://uidaho.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cUevKPbg1aulCtf). We encourage input from all members of the U of I community to assist us in deciding how to maximize the impact of our subscriptions budget.
