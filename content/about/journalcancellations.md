Throughout the year, the Library reviews its journal and database subscriptions to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of the campus community and that we are maximizing the impact of our subscriptions budget.

Earlier this year, the Library reached a 5-year agreement with [Elsevier](https://www-sciencedirect-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/) to bring back access to more than 2300 academic journals. 
With this agreement, the Library also secured open access provisions that [give U of I authors a discount to make their work open access](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/agreements/elsevier.html). 
This investment in our researchers and students is an important step toward the university's goal of reaching R1 research classification, and in order to fund this package, the Library has made the tough decision to cancel approximately 200 journals from two other providers.

Input from members of our campus community has always been vital to our evaluative process and any feedback you may have on these proposed cancellations is appreciated and will be used in making our final decisions.

The first set of cancellations â€‹came from a variety of publishers and providers and has been finalized after collecting feedback.

Our second (and final) list of cancellations are from the publisher Wiley, and can be reviewed by downloading the [proposed Wiley cancellations spreadsheet]({{ site.lib-media }}/about/2022_proposed_journal_cuts_Wiley.xlsx). 
This list was determined using subscriptions prices, usage statistics, and resulting cost per use metrics. 
Please share your feedback on these titles by September 21 using the survey link below.

Any journals that are cancelled will remain available via [Interlibrary Loan]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}). 
If we do cancel something that you would like us to keep, the journal will be rated highly in future discussions as funding becomes available. 
Thank you for your support through this process.
