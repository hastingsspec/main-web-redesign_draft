<p>The Library subscribes to thousands of electronic journals, books and other databases for use by authorized users (current faculty, students and staff and on-site visitors). The terms and conditions for using these resources are set out in electronic resource license agreements with each publisher. It is the responsibility of individual users to contact the library if they are unsure if their use of electronic resources may not comply with the terms and conditions specified in the license agreements. Licenses vary from publisher to publisher; however, the general principles are:</p>

    <li>sending a copy of an article to another authorized user (i.e. current faculty, students or staff)</li>
