{% include feature/alert.html text="Requests are subject to the following guidelines:

- Priority is given to materials which support the research and teaching programs of the university.
- Out-of-print books will be considered for purchase if they can be found at a reasonable cost.
- Requests must be submitted at least 60 days before the time needed to allow for shipping and processing time. Out-of-print items and items ordered as pre-publications may take longer. If you need an item soon, please use Interlibrary Loan to borrow a copy from another library.
- Up to 10 item requests can be purchased for each individual patron per academic year.
- The appropriate library subject specialist will review your request.
