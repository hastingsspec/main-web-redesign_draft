            <p>The University of Idaho Library has many types of maps and atlases. Most maps can be found by using the library's
                  catalog. An advanced search will allow you to limit your results to maps.</p>
            <p>Not all maps at the UI Library have been cataloged, however; use the paper index located in the map room to find
                  additional items. If you have a specific geographic area in mind (Europe, Costa Rica, or Idaho for example),
                  the paper index can point you to the drawers where those maps are located. The index can also help you
                  find maps on specific topics (such as natural resources, transportation routes, or demographics). Just
                  <a href="{{ '/help/' | relative_url}}">ask a reference librarian</a> if you have questions about using the index.</p>

            <h3>Topographic Maps</h3>
            <p>Topographic maps are based on topographical surveys and show both natural and man-made features. Contour lines
                  are used to depict elevation while the legend and margins contain other useful information. These maps
                  are often used by hikers to plan routes as they offer information about the terrain of an area.</p>
            <p>
                  <b>Topographic Maps in Print</b>
            </p>
            <p>In December 2009, the United States Geological Service announced it would no longer produce print topographic
                  maps. The University of Idaho Library will continue to provide access to all topographic maps currently
                  in its possession.</p>
            <p>
                  <b>Topographic Maps Online</b>
            </p>
            <p>You can download Topo Maps free of charge by visiting
                  <a href="http://nationalmap.gov/ustopo/index.html">The National Map</a> website or using Inside Idaho's <a href="https://www.insideidaho.org/apps/topomaps-explorer/">Idaho Historical Topographic Maps Explorer</a>. The USGS is currently scanning all editions and scales of topo maps produced
                  since the topo mapping program began in 1884. The total number of maps to be scanned is estimated at 200,000
                  although the exact number is not known at this time.</p>

            <h3>Aerial Photographs</h3>
            <p>The University of Idaho Library has a very large collection of historical aerial photographs. These are photos
                  taken by government agencies (Forest Service, Corps of Engineers, Soil Conservation Service, etc.), with
                  90% being of Idaho. These photographs are located in the Library Map Room on the first floor, and many
                  digitized air photos are also available through the
                  <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/aerial/">Idaho Historical Aerial Photographs collection</a> and Inside Idaho's <a href="https://www.insideidaho.org/apps/imagery-explorer/">Idaho Aerial Imagery Explorer</a></p>
