<h2>Streaming Video</h2>

<p>The library has access to two streaming video platforms which can be accessed on campus or by logging in with your UI account:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://digitalcampus.swankmp.net/unividaho295672/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swank Digital Campus</a> - The library has procured unlimited access to the top 250 films in Swank Film Library (most popular titles based on bookings at universities and colleges around the United States).</li>
    <li><a href="http://ida.lib.uidaho.edu:2048/login?url=https://uidaho.kanopy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kanopy</a> - the library purchases one year licenses to films on demand from the Kanopy catalog. Using our mediated purchasing model, patrons will need to submit a request to the library in order to access new Kanopy videos. Requests can be submitted via the Kanopy website.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions about these services or need to view a streaming video from a provider other than Kanopy or Swank, please send a request to Jodi Haire at haire@uidaho.edu.</p>
