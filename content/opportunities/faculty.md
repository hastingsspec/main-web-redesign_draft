## Our Library

Candidates will join an innovative workplace with an opportunity to develop new roles in a recently reorganized library. These positions will be establishing new programs, working with leading technology and collaborating together to rethink how we organize data at the library.

Candidates will join a dynamic staff and faculty group that have decades of experience with the University of Idaho as well as many talented individuals who have been hired over the last year as digital, data and research specialists. The library is also diligent about developing and promoting internally, with three internal candidates hired for positions since fall of 2023. 

The library’s [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) has designed and maintained [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), an open source framework for creating digital collections and exhibit websites, driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology. The department has showcased CollectionBuilder at the Global Digital Humanities Symposium, Code4Lib and the DLF Forum and has been utilized by hundreds of academic and cultural institutions. Visit our [CollectionBuilder Examples](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/) site to see more.

The library offers a range of [innovative student and faculty fellowships opportunities](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/opportunities/fellowships/), utilizing library collections and expertise to develop projects and research. Fellowship areas of focus include open access publishing, digital scholarship, GIS, and faculty development and are designed to encourage institutional growth and interdepartmental collaboration. 

We are committed to engaging with and being of service to our community. In fall 2023, our [Special Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) department collaborated with the Latah County Historical Society to host an archival [“unboxing event”](https://www.lmtribune.com/northwest/long-awaited-unboxing-of-psychiana-s-prized-find-a-diary/article_c24b3eb1-089a-5b19-9891-ae2e4734a954.html) at our local theater.

Our faculty regularly contribute articles to the Moscow-Pullman Daily News and Lewiston Tribune to let the community know what we are working on. Digitally, we are working on several projects to track analytics of our library site to make more informed design decisions based on user interaction and gaining a better understanding of how well our digital collections represent the greater Latah county community. 

Regarding special collections, we are a proud member of the [Orbis Cascade Alliance](https://www.orbiscascade.org/), a consortium of 39 colleges and universities across Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. In addition to special collections highlighted in our [central repository](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/), we engage with the community through [The Harvester](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/), a blog and working collection of unique archival materials where our archivists can expand on smaller histories and how they relate to the archive as a whole.
