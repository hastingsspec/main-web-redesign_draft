## Our Library

Candidates will join an innovative and energetic workplace with an opportunity to develop new roles, establish new programs, work with cutting-edge technology, and collaborate to reimagine data organization at the library. The dynamic staff and faculty group at the University of Idaho boasts decades of experience, enhanced by the recent addition of many talented digital, data, and research specialists.  

Our Library faculty regularly publish in top journals, present internationally at important venues, and receive significant grants from agencies including the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institution for Museum and Library Services (over one million in the last five years). Just as important, our employees are interesting, supportive, kind people dedicated to serving our community while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.  

The U of I Library is well connected in the region as a proud member of the [Orbis Cascade Alliance](https://www.orbiscascade.org/), a consortium of 39 colleges and universities across Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. We also stay connected with our academic partners throughout the state as members of the newly established [Network of Idaho Academic Libraries](https://idahoacademiclibraries.org/).

Our new Open Publishing Librarian will come into a program with enormous potential. For example, the Library’s recent collaboration with Dr. Sydney Freeman helped produce [The Seminal History and Prospective Future of Blacks at the University of Idaho](https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/blackhistory/), a book that was produced in both electronic and print formats, and accompanied by campus events, a travelling exhibition, and an extensive [digital collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/blackhistory/).  

That project uses [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), an open source framework for creating digital collections and exhibit websites developed at the Library’s [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/).
This innovative tool powers our [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and scholarship projects, and has been showcased at events like the Global Digital Humanities Symposium, Code4Lib, and the DLF Forum. It has been used by hundreds of academic and cultural institutions, some of which you can explore in our [CollectionBuilder Examples](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/) site.

Our new Digital Archivist and Archivist and Special Collections Librarian will join a department committed to community engagement. Our Special Collections and Archives faculty regularly contribute articles to regional publications including the Moscow-Pullman Daily News and Lewiston Tribune. We also engage with the community through [The Harvester](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/), a blog and working collection of unique archival materials where our archivists can expand on smaller histories and how they relate to the archive as a whole. 

We also partner with local and regional groups to bring history to diverse audiences. 
For example, last fall we partnered with the Latah County Historical Society to organize an archival [“unboxing event”](https://www.lmtribune.com/northwest/long-awaited-unboxing-of-psychiana-s-prized-find-a-diary/article_c24b3eb1-089a-5b19-9891-ae2e4734a954.html) that highlighted a unique story in Moscow’s past. 
Our archive also collaborates to make materials more accessible through exhibitions and displays, like with the [Barnard Stockbridge Museum](https://www.barnardstockbridge.com/) in Wallace, Idaho. 

There’s so much more to say about the U of I Library (our student engagement programs are really top notch, we collaborate across campus for almost everything we do, and so much more!), but you’d probably like to know a bit more about the University of Idaho.

## Our University

Candidates will enter the university at an exciting point in its nearly 130 year old lifespan, with the second largest enrollment in recorded history in fall 2023. For the fourth year in a row, the university has been ranked as the “Best Value Public University in the West” by the U.S. News and World Report and second in the nation. 

In addition to being the leading research institution in the state, the university is also a land-grant institution, with [46 extension centers](https://www.uidaho.edu/extension/directory/counties) in 42 of Idaho’s 44 counties. These centers support researchers, educators, and specialists in the disciplines of forestry and natural resources, horticulture, aquaculture, and much more, in a long-standing effort to empower youth and develop communities across Idaho.

## Our Community

Moscow is located in north Idaho, just 10 minutes away from Pullman, Washington (home to [another major university](https://wsu.edu/)) and an hour and half from Spokane and Coeur d’Alene. The University of Idaho is at the heart of the community, and Moscow benefits from a diverse workforce and community commitment to education. The town’s nickname is the “Heart of the Arts,” and for good reason.

Visual and performing arts are easy to find, be it a photography display at the [Moscow Food Co-op](https://www.moscowfood.coop/), a classic film at the [Kenworthy Performing Arts Centre](https://www.kenworthy.org/), or a Saturday night musical performance at [Hunga Dunga Brewing Company](https://www.hungadungabrewing.com/). There are enough outdoor recreation opportunities to keep every hiker, [mountain biker](https://mambatrails.org/), and angler happy. Moscow’s summers are particularly special, with a nationally recognized [Farmers Market](https://www.ci.moscow.id.us/197/Community-Events-Division-Moscow-Farmers) each weekend and a number of community festivals throughout the season.
