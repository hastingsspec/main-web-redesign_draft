## Call for Applications

Think Open Fellowships are designed to support faculty in adopting Open Educational Resources (OER) in the courses they teach. The Think Open Fellowship program is intended to reduce barriers to student success by supporting the use of low or no‐cost course materials in place of traditional textbooks. The program’s goal is to improve student success by adopting, creating, and using open educational resources at the University of Idaho. To date Think Open Fellows have saved University of Idaho students over $500,000.

### Eligibility

Faculty and Graduate Students with teaching appointments are eligible for awards of $1,200 to support the transition of an upcoming University of Idaho course to open materials.

Think Open Fellows are required to:

* Commit to using an open textbook or affordable alternative (total costs less than $30) for a upcoming course that currently uses a traditional publisher's textbook.

* Agree to share the resources and content they create on the Think Open OER Commons group.

* Work with the Open Education Librarian and other University of Idaho Librarians to identify and create open educational resources that support the instructor's course goals.

* Deliver a syllabus that uses only open or other low-cost materials (less than $30 total).

Faculty teaching high enrollment courses are especially encouraged to apply, as well as those hoping to improve historically marginalized representations in their curriculums.
