**_Call for Applications:_**

The University of Idaho Library is now accepting applications for the 2019 Think Open Fellowship. These fellowships are designed to support faculty in adopting Open Educational Resources (OERs) in the courses they teach.

There are two types of fellowships available for faculty and one type available for graduate students:

**First Year Fellows ($1250)** -- awarded to faculty who will use Open Educational Resources in their classes.

**Continuing Fellowships ($1000)** -- awarded to previous Think Open fellows to expand their work with open educational resources

**Graduate Student Fellowships ($15/hr totaling $1050)** -- The graduate student fellowship funds hourly employment at the library while working on OER projects, either self-directed or in collaboration with a faculty member.

The Think Open fellowship is intended to reduce barriers to student success by supporting the use of low‐or no‐cost course materials in place of traditional textbooks. The program’s goal is to improve student success by adopting, creating, and using open educational resources at the University of Idaho. The 2017 Fellows are estimated to have saved students more than $50,000 in textbook costs. So far the 2018 cohort is estimated to have saved students more than $150,000 in one year.

**_Faculty Fellows are expected to:_**

*   Commit to using an open textbook or affordable alternative (total costs less than $50) for a course in fall 2019 or spring 2020 (preference given to high enrollment and general education courses).
*   Work collaboratively with other fellows, mentors, and fellowship director(s) on best practices, policy recommendations, advocacy, and research.
*   Collect feedback from students in OER-based courses about the course materials required, their academic performance, and other metrics as agreed upon by the fellowship mentors and director.

**_Graduate Fellows are expected to:_**

*   Assist with the development of courses and materials
*   Work with project directors to add value to courses and the fellowships
*   Perform other necessary duties to support the program

**The application deadline has been extended to April 12th, 2019!**
