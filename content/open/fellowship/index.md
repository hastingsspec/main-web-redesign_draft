The University of Idaho Library’s **Think Open Fellowship** is an opportunity to equalize access to educational materials in your classroom and save your students money by supporting the use of low- or no-cost course materials in place of traditional textbooks. 

**Think Open Fellowships** also allow faculty and graduate students to identify and create openly licensed materials that increase quality representation and inclusion of people from marginalized identities. 

The Think Open Fellowship Grants are intended to:

1. Lower the cost of college for students and contribute to their retention, progression, and graduation.
2. Pilot different approaches in University of Idaho courses for textbook transformation including adopting and adapting existing resources, creating Open Educational Resources (OER), and identifying materials already available from the UI Library.
3. Provide support to faculty to implement these approaches.

This fellowship awards $1,200 to selected faculty and graduate students. Fellows are expected to:

* Commit to using an open textbook or affordable alternative (total cost less than $30) for an upcoming course(faculty teaching high enrollment courses, dual-enrollment courses, and Idaho Gem courses are especially encouraged to apply).

* Meet regularly with the Open Education Librarian.

* Agree to share the resources and content they create on the Think Open OER Commons group.

* Deliver a final syllabus for their course that uses Open or other low-cost materials (less than $30).

Faculty can apply to transform _any_ course in this fellowship program. Faculty teaching [Idaho GEM courses](http://coursetransfer.idaho.gov/GEMsearch.aspx), high enrollment courses, and [dual-enrollment courses](https://dualcredit.uidaho.edu/) are especially encouraged to apply. The Think Open Program also welcomes applications from faculty hoping to increase quailty representation of marginalized identities in their course materials.
