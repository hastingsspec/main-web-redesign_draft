The University of Idaho Library’s **Think Open Fellowship** is an opportunity to equalize access to educational materials in your classroom and save your students money by supporting the use of low- or no-cost course materials in place of traditional textbooks. **Think Open Fellowship's** also allow faculty and graduate students to identify and create openly licensed materials that increase quality representation and inclusion of people from marginlzied identities. 

The Think Open Fellowship Grants are intended to:

1.  Lower the cost of college for students and contribute to their retention, progression, and graduation.
2.  Pilot different approaches in University of Idaho courses for textbook transformation including adopting and adapting existing resources, creating Open Educational Resources (OER), and identifying materials already available from the UI Library.
3.  Provide support to faculty to implement these approaches.

This fellowship awards up to $1,250 to selected faculty and graduate students, Fellows are expected to:

*   Commit to using an open textbook or affordable alternative (total cost less than $50) for a course in Fall 2019 or Spring 2020 (faculty teaching high enrollment courses, dual-enrollment courses, and Idaho Gem courses are especially encouraged to apply).

*   Participate in Think Open Group cohort meetings.

*   Share the resources and content they create on the Think Open OER Commons group.
