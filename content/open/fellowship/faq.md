**What is the time commitment?**

Faculty fellows would be expected to attend about 10 hours of workshops and cohort events. The time needed to convert course materials, syllabi, and course planning is relative to each faculty member, course, and subject area – budget between 5-10 hours. Additional time for bi-weekly or monthly meetings.

**Which courses are eligible for this project?**

Faculty can apply to transform _any_ course in this fellowship program. Faculty teaching [Idaho GEM courses](http://coursetransfer.idaho.gov/GEMsearch.aspx), high enrollment courses, and [dual-enrollment courses](https://dualcredit.uidaho.edu/) are especially encouraged to apply, as reducing the cost of course materials in these courses will have the highest impact.
