**What is the time commitment?**

Faculty fellows will work over the course of one to two semesters to find, create, and adapt OER for a current or upcoming University of Idaho course. Fellows meet throughout their fellowship with the Open Education Librarian, as well as other Library faculty as different kinds of expertise are required. 

**Which courses are eligible for this project?**

Faculty can apply to transform _any_ course in this fellowship program. Faculty teaching [Idaho GEM courses](http://coursetransfer.idaho.gov/GEMsearch.aspx), high enrollment courses, and [dual-enrollment courses](https://dualcredit.uidaho.edu/) are especially encouraged to apply. The Think Open Program also welcomes applications from faculty hoping to increase quality representation of marginalized identities in their course materials.
