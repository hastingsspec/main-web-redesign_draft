        <h4>The Library supports Open Education in a number of ways:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="h5">Our <a href="{{ '/open/fellowship/' | relative_url }}">Think Open Fellow program</a> has run for three cohorts, and has saved students over <b>$200,000</b> in textbook costs! Faculty can apply for this program which includes a small stipend and extensive library support to develop OA solutions for courses and research. </li>

            <li class="h5">The <a href="{{ '/services/oapf/' | relative_url }}">Open Access Publishing</a> fund, provided by the University of Idaho Library, Office of the Provost, and Office of Research and Economic Development, helps U of I researchers and scholars publish in fully open and peer-reviewed OA journals by covering article processing charges. Now in its second year, the OA Fund has made <b>$60,000</b> available to University of Idaho researchers.</li>

            <li class="h5">The Library works closely with faculty to integrate and implement open educational resources in their classrooms. Contact <a href="mailto:marcosv@uidaho.edu" title="email"> Open Education Librarian Marco Seiferle-Valencia</a> for help implementing OER materials in your classroom!</li>
