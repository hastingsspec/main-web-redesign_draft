<p>Open @ UI Library aims to reduce the costs and barriers associated with accessing educational materials and research. Open @ UI Library benefits Vandals as well as the greater Idaho, national, and international scholarly communities.  
</p>

<h4>Open @ UI Library can refer to:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Academic, scholarly, or research articles that are free for the reader, often called Open Access </li>
        <li>Specific journals or materials published using special licenses that allow for republication or reuse, such as Creative Commons Licenses  </li>
        <li>The praxis of professors and teachers choosing curriculum that is openly licensed or low cost  </li>

    </ul>
<h4>At the UofI, we’re supporting Open Education in a number of ways:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Our <a href="https://libguides.uidaho.edu/THINKOPEN">Think Open Fellow program</a> has run for two cohorts, and has already saved students over $150,000 in textbook costs! Faculty can apply for this program which includes a small stipend and extensive library support to develop OA solutions for courses and research. </li>
         <li>The <a href="{{ '/services/oapf/' | relative_url }}">Open Access Publishing</a> fund, provided by the University of Idaho Library, Office of the Provost, and Office of Research and Economic Development, helps U of I researchers and scholars publish in fully open and peer-reviewed OA journals by covering article processing charges. </li>
        <li>The Library works closely with faculty to integrate and implement open educational resources in their classrooms</li>
    </ul>
