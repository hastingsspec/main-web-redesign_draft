<p class="lead">University of Idaho Library supports initiatives in Open Access and Open Education to make an impact across campus and the world.

<ul>
    <li>Our <a href="https://libguides.uidaho.edu/THINKOPEN">Think Open Fellow program</a> has run for two cohorts, and has already saved students over $150,000 in textbook costs! Faculty can apply for this program which includes a small stipend and extensive library support to develop OA solutions for courses and research. </li>
        <li>The <a href="{{ '/services/oapf/' | relative_url }}">Open Access Publishing</a> fund, provided by the University of Idaho Library, Office of the Provost, and Office of Research and Economic Development, helps U of I researchers and scholars publish in fully open and peer-reviewed OA journals by covering article processing charges. </li>
