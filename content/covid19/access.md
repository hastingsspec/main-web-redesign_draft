The below lists a variety of ways you can access library resources online from anywhere. 

### Get Online Help! 

Need help finding articles or have other library questions? 
We are online with extended hours, ready to answer questions from anywhere.
Just [ask us](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/help/chat.html)! 

Visit the [Reference Services]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) page to connect with U of I librarians via chat, text, or email. 
Or visit the [Gary Strong Curriculum Center guide](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/GSCC) for information about their new virtual service via Zoom. 

### Librarian Consultations 

Subject librarians with expertise in specific areas are available for remote consultations via a variety of methods, including phone, email, or via Zoom. Contact your [subject librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html) to make an appointment! 

### Research Guides 

Trying to make sense of library resources can be confusing. To help, we've created hundreds of [research guides](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/?b=s) that are tailored to UI classes and subjects.  

### Online Resources 

The library has tons of materials you can access online. Check our [library catalog](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=UID&sortby=rank&mode=advanced) for e-books, articles, and more, or [browse our databases](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/az.php?) for scholarly and scientific articles.  

### Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery 

Even if you're not on campus, we can still help you get electronic access to materials the library doesn't own via [Interlibrary Loan (ILL)](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/). 

Never used ILL before? You will need to [create a unique account](https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/FirstTime.html) before you can place your requests. Please keep in mind that ILL is limited to UI students, staff, and faculty.  

### Off-Campus Access 

To use the library off-campus, you'll need to log in to our catalog or databases with your VandalID, the same credentials you use to access email and BBLearn. Stuck? [Ask us for help](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/help/chat.html) or see if your question is answered in this [guide for off-campus students](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/c.php?g=363086&p=2453098).     

### Special Collections & Archives  

Many of the unique materials held by Special Collections & Archives are discoverable via our [digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/). The rest of our holdings can be searched via Archives West or the [Special Collections website](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/). For assistance with finding and accessing this material, please contact our Special Collections staff via email (<libspec@uidaho.edu>) or phone (208-885-0845).
