### Librarian Consultations 

Subject librarians with expertise in specific areas are available for remote consultations via a variety of methods, including email or via Zoom. 
Visit our [Research Assistance page]({{ '/help/research.html' | relative_url }}) to make an appointment! 

### Research Guides 

Trying to make sense of library resources can be confusing. To help, we've created hundreds of [research guides](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/?b=s) that are tailored to UI classes and subjects.  

### Online Resources 

The library has tons of materials you can access online. Check our [library catalog](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=UID&sortby=rank&mode=advanced) for e-books, articles, and more, or [browse our databases](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/az.php?) for scholarly and scientific articles.  

### Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery 

Even if you're not on campus, we can still help you get electronic access to materials the library doesn't own via [Interlibrary Loan (ILL)](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/). 

Never used ILL before? 
You will need to [create a unique account](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll) before you can place your requests. 
Please keep in mind that ILL is limited to U of I students, staff, and faculty.  

### Curbside Delivery

Starting June 15th, patrons will be able to request locally-owned physical items from the UI Library and pick them up curbside. 
To request an item, navigate to the [library's online catalog](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=UID&mode=advanced) and search for a title. 
Then use the "Request Curbside Pick Up" link to place your request; you'll receive an email when your item is ready, with a link to reserve a pick up time slot during open hours, Monday to Friday. 
Please note that due to staffing and safety protocols it may take two or more business days from the time you place your request to receive your items! Contact us at libcirc@uidaho.edu with questions.

### Off-Campus Access 

To use the library off-campus, you'll need to log in to our catalog or databases with your VandalID, the same credentials you use to access email and BBLearn. Stuck? [Ask us for help](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/help/chat.html) or see if your question is answered in this [guide for off-campus students](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/c.php?g=363086&p=2453098).     

### Special Collections & Archives  

Many of the unique materials held by Special Collections & Archives are discoverable via our [digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/). The rest of our holdings can be searched via Archives West or the [Special Collections website](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/). For assistance with finding and accessing this material, please contact our Special Collections staff via email (<libspec@uidaho.edu>).
