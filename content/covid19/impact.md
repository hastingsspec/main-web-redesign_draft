If you are planning to visit the library, please be sure to follow [World Health Organization guidelines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) by washing your hands, maintaining social distance, and staying home if you feel unwell or are in a high-risk population.  

### Hours and Availability 

The Library is reducing its open hours and areas for the remainder of spring semester.

### Reference Desk

The main reference desk is closed with all [Reference Services]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) virtual only.
However, to help with this transition, reference hours have been **expanded**!

Visit the [Reference Services]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) page to ask librarians questions via chat, text, or email. 
You can also make a research appointment for individualized help via Zoom, tailored to finding relevant resources for your specific information need.

### Collections and Services

The [Gary Strong Curriculum Center]({{ '/services/curriculumcenter.html' | relative_url }}) will be closed to the public with services available online only.

[The MILL]({{ '/mill/' | relative_url }}), [The Studio]({{ '/studio/' | relative_url }}), and [CDIL](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) will be closed until face to face classes resume.

The [Special Collections Collections & Archives]({{ '/special-collections/' | relative_url }}) Reading Room will be open by appointment only. For assistance with finding and accessing archival material, please contact our Special Collections staff via email (libspec@uidaho.edu) or phone (208-885-0845). 

### Resource Sharing

The Interlibrary Loan office is currently closed to the public, but services are available during normal operating hours online via email. 
Resource sharing is currently limited to electronic delivery due to library closures across the country. 

**Summit**

Our regional resource sharing consortium, the Orbis Cascade Alliance, has suspended all Summit borrowing effective March 20th. We will be processing remaining requests and will be communicating updates as we learn more from our consortium.   

**Interlibrary Loan**

Due to library closures and limitations across the country, we are currently unable to process printed material. 
However, patrons can still request digital articles and/or book chapters. 
Please be advised standard delivery estimates are not in effect and there are likely to be delays in fulfillment. 
For help, please contact the [ILL office]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}). 

### Fines and Fees

The library will be waiving fines for UI or Summit materials accrued after March 9th, so don't worry if you left for spring break with a bunch of books! Please note this doesn't apply to lost or damaged books. 

Have a book from ILL that will be overdue? Please contact the ILL office at [libill@uidaho.edu](mailto:libill@uidaho.edu) or (208) 885-6843 so we can help you extend your due date.
