If you are planning to visit the library, please be sure to follow [World Health Organization guidelines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) by washing your hands, maintaining social distance, and staying home if you feel unwell or are in a high-risk population.  

### Hours

We will be moving to [spring break hours](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/hours.html) as scheduled beginning March 13th, and will be evaluating open hours after break as the situation evolves. 

### Fines and Fees

The library will be waiving fines for UI or Summit materials accrued after March 9th, so don't worry if you left for spring break with a bunch of books! Please note this doesn't apply to lost or damaged books. 

Have a book from ILL that will be overdue? Please contact the ILL office at [libill@uidaho.edu](mailto:libill@uidaho.edu) or (208) 885-6843 so we can help you extend your due date. 

### Special Collections & Archives

The Special Collections Collections & Archives reading room will be open by appointment only. For assistance with finding and accessing archival material, please contact our Special Collections staff via email (libspec@uidaho.edu) or phone (208-885-0845).
