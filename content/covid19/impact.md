We continue to offer [extensive online services]({{ '/covid19/access.html' | relative_url }}), including our [reference desk and research help]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) with extended hours.

#### Reference Desk

All [Reference Services]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) are virtual only.

Virtual Reference Summer Hours (online):

- Monday - Friday: 1pm - 4pm

Visit the [Reference Services page]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) to ask librarians questions via chat, text, or email. 
You can also make an appointment for individualized research help via Zoom, tailored to finding relevant resources for your specific information need.
Visit the [Research Assistance page]({{ '/help/research.html' | relative_url }}) to request a meeting.

#### Curbside Delivery

U of I and community Patrons can request locally-owned physical items from the Library and pick them up curbside. 
To request an item, navigate to the [library's online catalog](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=UID&mode=advanced) and search for a title. 
Then use the "Request Curbside Pick Up" link to place your request. 
You'll receive an email when your item is ready, with a link to reserve a pick up time slot during our open hours, Monday to Friday. 

Please note that due to staffing and safety protocols it may take two or more business days from the time you place your request to receive your items! Contact us at libcirc@uidaho.edu with questions. 

#### Tutoring

All tutoring sessions normally held in the library are now being offered remotely via Zoom.
Please check the services' web pages for more information:

- Tutoring & College Success is offering drop-in [Online Tutoring](https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/academic-support/asp/tcs/tutoring/online-tutoring) sessions.

## Collections and Service

The [Gary Strong Curriculum Center]({{ '/services/curriculumcenter.html' | relative_url }}) will reopened with limited hours, Monday through Thursday 9:00am - 12:00pm.

[Special Collections & Archives]({{ '/special-collections/' | relative_url }}) and its Reading Room are by appointment only.
See [Reading Room Rules]({{ '/special-collections/rules.html#reading-room-reopening' | relative_url }}) for details of SPEC reopening. 
Many of the unique materials held by Special Collections & Archives are discoverable via our [digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/). 
The rest of our holdings can be searched via Archives West or the [Special Collections website](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/). 

[The MILL]({{ '/mill/' | relative_url }}), [The Studio]({{ '/studio/' | relative_url }}), and [CDIL](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) will be closed until face to face classes resume.

#### Resource Sharing

The Interlibrary Loan office is open during library hours. 
Services are also available during normal operating hours online via email. 

Although summit and ILL physical resource sharing has resumed, not all libraries are lending items at this time.
As a result, please be advised standard delivery estimates are not in effect and there are likely to be delays in fulfillment. 
For help, please contact the [ILL office]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}).

## Checked-out Books 

The library will be waiving fines for U of I or Summit materials accrued after March 9th, so don’t worry if you still have your library books! 
Please note this doesn't apply to lost or damaged books, which will still generate fines. 
The library has extended due dates to July 15th for all materials currently checked out. 

The library's exterior book drops are open, so please return your materials at your convenience.
Please note that we are alternating use of the two book drops at the library in order to allow the materials to "self-quarantine" for 3+ days based on CDC guidelines.
Signs are posted to direct visitors to the correct drop.

- Monday - Wednesday: return books to the drop located next to the library's front door
- Thursday - Sunday: return books to drop located on the east side of the library, near Rayburn St.

Have a book from ILL that will be overdue? 
Please contact the ILL office at [libill@uidaho.edu](mailto:libill@uidaho.edu) so we can help you extend your due date. 

If you have additional questions about any library materials that you have checked out, please contact us at [libcirc@uidaho.edu](mailto:libcirc@uidaho.edu).
