{:.alert .alert-warning}
If you are planning to visit the library, please be sure to follow [World Health Organization guidelines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) by washing your hands, maintaining social distance, and staying home if you feel unwell or are in a high-risk population.  

### Hours

Currently we are on [spring break hours](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/hours.html#springbreak).

Beginning on Sunday, March 22nd at 10am, the Library will be reducing our open hours. Though these hours are subject to change based on usage, we will begin with the following:

- Monday: 8am – midnight
- Tuesday: 8am – midnight
- Wednesday: 8am – midnight
- Thursday: 8am – midnight
- Friday: 8am – 8pm

The [Gary Strong Curriculum Center]({{ '/services/curriculumcenter.html' | relative_url }}) will be closed to the public with services available online only.

[The MILL]({{ '/mill/' | relative_url }}), [The Studio]({{ '/studio/' | relative_url }}), and [CDIL](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) will be closed until face to face classes resume.

The [Special Collections Collections & Archives]({{ '/special-collections/' | relative_url }}) Reading Room will be open by appointment only. For assistance with finding and accessing archival material, please contact our Special Collections staff via email (libspec@uidaho.edu) or phone (208-885-0845).

### Resource Sharing

Resource sharing is currently limited to electronic delivery due to library closures across the country. 

**Summit**

Our regional resource sharing consortium, the Orbis Cascade Alliance, has suspended all Summit borrowing effective March 20th. We will be processing remaining requests and will be communicating updates as we learn more from our consortium.   

**Interlibrary Loan**

Due to library closures and limitations across the country, we are currently unable to process printed material. However, patrons can still request digital articles and/or book chapters. Please be advised standard delivery estimates are not in effect and there are likely to be delays in fulfillment. For help, please contact the [ILL office]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}). 

### Fines and Fees

The library will be waiving fines for UI or Summit materials accrued after March 9th, so don't worry if you left for spring break with a bunch of books! Please note this doesn't apply to lost or damaged books. 

Have a book from ILL that will be overdue? Please contact the ILL office at [libill@uidaho.edu](mailto:libill@uidaho.edu) or (208) 885-6843 so we can help you extend your due date.
