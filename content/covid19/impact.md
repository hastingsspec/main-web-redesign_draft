If you are planning to visit the library, please be sure to follow [World Health Organization guidelines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) by washing your hands, maintaining social distance, and staying home if you feel unwell or are in a high-risk population.  -->

## Hours and Availability 

The Library is currently open online only, with the building closed to the public.
We continue to offer [extensive online services]({{ '/covid19/access.html' | relative_url }}), including our reference desk and research help with extended hours.
The Library building will follow a [phased reopening model]({{ site.lib-media }}/about/UI_Library_Covid-19_Phased_Reopening_Model.pdf){:target="_blank"} guided by Idaho Rebounds, university plans, and public health guidance.

#### Reference Desk

All [Reference Services]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) are virtual only.

Virtual Reference Summer Hours (online):

- Monday - Friday: 1pm - 4pm

Visit the [Reference Services page]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) to ask librarians questions via chat, text, or email. 
You can also make an appointment for individualized research help via Zoom, tailored to finding relevant resources for your specific information need.
Visit the [Research Assistance page]({{ '/help/research.html' | relative_url }}) to request a meeting.

#### Curbside Delivery

Starting June 15th, patrons will be able to request locally-owned physical items from the UI Library and pick them up curbside. 
To request an item, navigate to the [library's online catalog](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=UID&mode=advanced) and search for a title. 
Then use the "Request Curbside Pick Up" link to place your request; you'll receive an email when your item is ready, with a link to reserve a pick up time slot between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., Monday to Friday. 
Please note that due to staffing and safety protocols it may take two or more business days from the time you place your request to receive your items! Contact us at libcirc@uidaho.edu with questions. 

#### Tutoring

All tutoring sessions normally held in the library are now being offered remotely via Zoom.
Please check the services' web pages for more information:

- Tutoring & College Success is offering drop-in [Online Tutoring](https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/academic-support/asp/tcs/tutoring/online-tutoring) sessions.

## Collections and Services (Closures)

The [Gary Strong Curriculum Center]({{ '/services/curriculumcenter.html' | relative_url }}) will be closed to the public with services available online only.

[The MILL]({{ '/mill/' | relative_url }}), [The Studio]({{ '/studio/' | relative_url }}), and [CDIL](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) will be closed until face to face classes resume.

[Special Collections & Archives]({{ '/special-collections/' | relative_url }}) and its Reading Room are closed to the public. 

- Many of the unique materials held by Special Collections & Archives are discoverable via our [digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/). The rest of our holdings can be searched via Archives West or the [Special Collections website](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/). 
- For assistance, please contact our Special Collections staff via email (<libspec@uidaho.edu>).
- Reproduction requests for items not already digitized will be extremely limited due to staff availability. Permissions to use Special Collections materials will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

#### Resource Sharing

The Interlibrary Loan office is currently closed to the public, but services are available during normal operating hours online via email. 
Resource sharing is currently limited to electronic delivery due to library closures across the country. 

**Summit**

Our regional resource sharing consortium, the Orbis Cascade Alliance, has suspended all Summit borrowing effective March 20th. We will be processing remaining requests and will be communicating updates as we learn more from our consortium.   

**Interlibrary Loan**

Due to library closures and limitations across the country, we are currently unable to process printed material. 
However, patrons can still request digital articles and/or book chapters. 
Please be advised standard delivery estimates are not in effect and there are likely to be delays in fulfillment. 
For help, please contact the [ILL office]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}).

## Checked-out Books 

The library will be waiving fines for U of I or Summit materials accrued after March 9th, so don’t worry if you still have your library books! 
Please note this doesn't apply to lost or damaged books, which will still generate fines. 
The library has extended due dates to July 15th for all materials currently checked out. 

The library's exterior book drops are open, so please return your materials at your convenience.
Please note that we are alternating use of the two book drops at the library in order to allow the materials to "self-quarantine" for 3+ days based on CDC guidelines.
Signs are posted to direct visitors to the correct drop.

- Monday - Wednesday: return books to the drop located next to the library's front door
- Thursday - Sunday: return books to drop located on the east side of the library, near Rayburn St.

Have a book from ILL that will be overdue? 
Please contact the ILL office at [libill@uidaho.edu](mailto:libill@uidaho.edu) so we can help you extend your due date. 

If you have additional questions about any library materials that you have checked out, please contact us at [libcirc@uidaho.edu](mailto:libcirc@uidaho.edu).
