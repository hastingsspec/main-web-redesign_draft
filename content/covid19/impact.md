At this time, there are no changes or disruptions to regular library services. We will be moving to [spring break hours](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/hours.html) as scheduled beginning March 13th. This page will be updated when any changes to our operations or services occur.  

If you are planning to visit the library, please be sure to follow [World Health Organization guidelines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) by washing your hands, maintaining social distance, and staying home if you feel unwell or are in a high-risk population.
