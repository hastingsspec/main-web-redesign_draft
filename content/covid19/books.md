### Waived Fines

The library will be waiving fines for U of I or Summit materials accrued after March 9th, so don’t worry if you still have your library books! Please note this doesn’t apply to lost or damaged books, which will still generate fines. 

### Interlibrary Loan

Have a book from ILL that will be overdue? Please contact the ILL office at libill@uidaho.edu or (208) 885-6843 so we can help you extend your due date. 

If you have additional questions about any library materials that you have checked out, please contact us at <a href="mailto:libcirc@uidaho.edu">libcirc@uidaho.edu</a>.
