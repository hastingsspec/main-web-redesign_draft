<h4 class="pt-4"><strong>Contribute to the largest library in Idaho!</strong></h4>

<p>Since 1892, the University of Idaho Library has grown from a single classroom located in the University Administration Building to become the largest library in the state of Idaho, providing access to millions of resources and materials for U of I students, faculty, and alumni, as well as Idaho citizens. </p>

<p>We now house <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/pdf/stats.pdf">well over a million books</a> and almost ten thousand print and online periodical subscriptions. Additionally, we continue, as we have for over a century now, to serve as an official regional depository of U.S. federal government publications, making <a href="https://libguides.uidaho.edu/Documents">almost two million government documents</a> available to the public. </p>

<h4><strong>Bringing Idaho to the World</strong></h4>

<p>Not satisfied with only bringing the world to Idaho, we also bring Idaho to the world. Our <a href="{{ '/special-collections/' | relative_url }}">Special Collections and Archives</a> provide researchers access to unique historical photographs, archival maps and documents, rare books, and the <a href="http://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/">International Jazz Collections</a>, the premier jazz archives of the Pacific Northwest. </p>
<p>Our growing <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/">Digital Initiatives</a> department makes many of these and other unique resources freely available worldwide online via digital collections like the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/">Gem of the Mountains Digital Yearbook Collection</a> and the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/postcards/">Northwest Historical Postcards Collection</a>.</p>
