The Special Collections Department of the University of Idaho Library includes those materials that, because of subject coverage, rarity, source, condition, or form, are best handled separately from the General Collection. The several “collections” housed in this department are for research use by faculty, students, visiting scholars, and the public. However, the materials are non-circulating; their use is limited to the Special Collections [Reading Room](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/plan.html).

Access to the materials is provided primarily by the [library's catalog](https://search.lib.uidaho.edu/primo-explore/search?tab=everything&search_scope=everything&vid=UID) and Archives West (link to Archives West?). A knowledgeable staff and a variety of finding aids are available to assist researchers and retrieve materials for study.

## Manuscripts and Archives

Among the strengths of the Department of Special Collections and Archives is the acquisition, preservation, cataloging, and use of primary documentation of the history of Idaho and the West. The over 6,000 cubic feet of materials in the collections include personal papers of individuals and families; business records of lumber, railroad, mining, and other companies; papers of government officials, politicians, educators, authors, and business people; records of organizations such as religious, fraternal, and civic associations; and similar groups. They support research into nearly all facets of the history of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.

## Historical Photograph Collections

These collections consist of photographs in glass negative, negative, and print forms of life, people, and environments in Moscow and the University and surrounding areas. These images date from the mid-late 19th century to the 1970s and 1980s and record many events and places. Several of the Special Collection Historical Photograph Collections have been digitized by [UI Library Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/index.html) and can be viewed through their website.
