        <p>The Special Collections Department of the University of Idaho Library includes those materials that, because of subject
          coverage, rarity, source, condition, or form, are best handled separately from the General Collection. The several
          "collections" housed in this department are for research use by faculty, students, visiting scholars, and the public.
          However, the materials are non-circulating; their use is limited to the Special Collections
          <a href="rules.html">Reading Room</a>, which is open 9am-4pm, Monday through Friday (Summer hours: 10am - 2pm Monday through Friday,
          or by appointment).</p>
        <p>Access to the materials is provided primarily by the
          <a href="http://search.lib.uidaho.edu">library's catalog</a> and
          <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/">Archives West</a>. A knowledgeable
          <a href="contactus.html">staff</a> and a variety of finding aids are available to assist researchers and retrieve materials for study.</p>

  <h2 id="mgdesc">Manuscripts and Archives</h2>
  <p>Among the strengths of the Department of Special Collections and Archives is the acquisition, preservation, cataloging,
    and use of primary documentation of the history of Idaho and the West. The over 6,000 cubic feet of materials in the
    collections include personal papers of individuals and families; business records of lumber, railroad, mining, and other
    companies; papers of government officials, politicians, educators, authors, and business people; records of organizations
    such as religious, fraternal, and civic associations; and similar groups. They support research into nearly all facets
    of the history of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest. </p>

  <p>The International Jazz Collection was formally established at the University of Idaho in 2000, and features papers and
    photographs of the legendary Lionel Hampton. Other important jazz figures included in the IJC are Leonard Feather, Lee
    Morse, Joe Williams, Dizzy Gillespie, Conte Candoli and Al Grey. The IJC merged into the Special Collections & Archives
    Department of the UI Library in 2007, and is now the preeminent jazz archive in the Pacific Northwest. The International
