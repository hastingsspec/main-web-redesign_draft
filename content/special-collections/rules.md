Access to the Reading Room will require visitors to adhere the following policies until further notice:  

- Reading Room visits will be **by appointment only**.
- Patrons are required to consult with us virtually or by phone prior to their visit, during which time we may determine if the request can be fulfilled digitally.   
- **Face masks are required** in the Reading Room at all times. 
- Only two visitors are allowed in the Reading Room at a time. 
- Visitors are expected to observe established seating arrangements within the Reading Room. 

Appointment hours are between 9am and 4pm Monday through Friday.  

Please contact libspec@uidaho.edu or 208-885-0845 to make an appointment. 
We ask for at least two business days of notice so we may do any preparatory searching and retrieving in advance.

- Please use outcards to preserve the existing order and arrangement of all unbound materials. Please use one box and one folder out at a time. Notify a staff member if material is found out of order.

## Copyright Restrictions

The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted materials. Under certain conditions specified in the law, archives and libraries are authorized to furnish a photocopy or reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship or research.” If a user later uses a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of “fair use,” they may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.
