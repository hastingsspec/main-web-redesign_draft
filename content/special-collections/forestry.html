We are also currently building a forestry portal to better organize and present our many digital collections related to forestry resources, such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/expforest/">Experimental Forest and Savenac Nursery Photo Archive</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/spec_pot">Family Tree Collection</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/plcphotos">Potlatch Lumber Company Photograph Collection</a>

The links point to a finding aid, which is a description of the collection and what it contains. In cases where that collection has been digitized, a link to a digital collection is also included.
