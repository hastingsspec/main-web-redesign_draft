# Reproduction Fees & Procedures

## Reproduction Requests 

We reserve the right to deny a reproduction request because of copyright regulations, privacy rights, donor-imposed regulations or other rights related issues, or due to the condition, size, or format of the materials.

Permission to examine Special Collections holdings is granted for reference purposes only. This does not include permission to publish, exhibit, broadcast or electronically disseminate the materials consulted by the researcher. Permission for these uses must be obtained by separate agreement and possible payment of fees with the department of Special Collections and Archives. In giving permission to copy, quote from, or publish, Special Collection does not surrender its own right to publish such material or grant permission to others to do so. Application for permission to use images is available upon request.

Please check with staff before scanning or photographing any materials. Staff will assist to ensure proper handling of materials. We provide two computers, two flatbed scanners, and digital camera stands for patron use. Cell phones with cameras and digital cameras are welcome to use under existing lighting (no flash). Personal scanners are permitted with staff approval.

Proper citation of all Special Collections materials is required. Preferred wording:

*[Description of item], [collection title], [Collection number], Special Collections and Archives, University of Idaho Library, Moscow, ID.*

Turnaround time is approximately 1-6 weeks but is dependent on the size of the request, equipment, and staff availability.
Offsite requests: scans/files will be delivered electronically through document sharing sites. Orders may be saved to CDs, DVDs, or thumb drives and mailed for additional charges.

## Copyright Restrictions

The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted materials. Under certain conditions specified in the law, archives and libraries are authorized to furnish a photocopy or reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship or research.” If a user later uses a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of “fair use,” they may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.
