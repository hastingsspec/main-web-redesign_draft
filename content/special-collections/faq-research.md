### What are "primary sources" and "secondary sources"?

Please see our Glossary for more information on primary and secondary sources.

### Do I need to cite primary sources that I found in the archives?

Yes! Primary sources and other archival materials are still subject to intellectual property rights, copyright, and trademark laws in the United States. The best way to avoid plagiarism is to use your own words (do not copy text verbatim) and cite all of your sources.

### How do I cite primary sources that came from the archive?

##### *For photographs:*
