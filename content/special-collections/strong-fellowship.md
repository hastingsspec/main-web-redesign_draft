### Call for Applications

The University of Idaho Library invites graduate students from any discipline at the University of Idaho to apply for the Gary E. and Carolyn J. Strong Special Collections Fellowship. This program funds one student each year to work for the faculty and staff at the Library to increase the visibility and use of previously unprocessed collections in the University of Idaho Library's Special Collections & Archives. The fellowship occurs during the summer for a period of six to eight weeks, with exact dates to be negotiated with the successful applicant. Though priority is given to doctoral students, masters students may be selected. Eligible applicants must have plans to enroll in the fall semester after the fellowship.

Applicants may select from projects listed below that they find interesting, and/or may submit a proposal for a different project which forward the goals of increasing the visibility and use of previously unprocessed collections in the U of I Library's Special Collections & Archives. The activities of the fellow will be focused on processing and digitizing previously unprocessed accessions. University of Idaho Library personnel will assist and guide the work; applicants will not be required to have experience in creating digital collections. 

The deliverables from the fellowship will be materials such as finding aids that assist in discovery and use of the collection, a digital collection hosted by the U of I Library, or a multi-modal interpretative essay that uses embedded digital items (images, PDFs, videos, etc.) from the fellow's research to introduce their research and describe their experience on the fellowship. All deliverables will be made publicly available through the U of I Library webpage. 

The award includes a $4,500 student fellowship paid as a bi-weekly stipend and up to $500 in research funds to help cover the cost of materials and supplies, project-related travel expenses, etc. 

For an example project please see ["Local League of Women Voters Papers Processed"](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/posts/2021/07/03/erin-geslani-2021-strong-fellow.html) on the Idaho Harvester blog, highlighting the work of Erin Geslani, the 2021 recipient of the Gary E. and Carolyn J. Strong Special Collections Fellowship.
