### Call for Applications

The University of Idaho Library invites graduate students from any discipline at the University of Idaho to apply for the Gary E. and Carolyn J. Strong Special Collections Fellowship. This program funds one student each year to work with the faculty and staff at the Library to increase the visibility and use of previously unprocessed collections in the University of Idaho Library’s Special Collections & Archives. The fellowship occurs during the summer for six to eight weeks, with exact dates to be negotiated with the successful applicant. Though priority is given to doctoral students, masters students may be selected. Eligible applicants must have plans to enroll in the fall semester after the fellowship. 

Applicants may select from projects listed below that they find interesting, and/or may submit a proposal for a different project which forwards the goals of increasing the visibility and use of previously unprocessed collections in the U of I Library’s Special Collections and Archives. The activities of the fellow will be focused on processing and digitizing previously unprocessed accessions. University of Idaho Library personnel will assist and guide the work; applicants are not required to have experience in creating digital collections.  

The deliverables from the fellowship will be materials such as finding aids that assist in discovery and use of the collection, a digital collection hosted by the U of I Library, or a multi-modal interpretative essay that uses embedded digital items (images, PDFs, videos, etc.) from the fellow’s research to introduce their research and describe their experience on the fellowship. All deliverables will be made publicly available through the U of I Library webpage. 

The award includes a $4,500 student fellowship and up to $500 in research funds to help cover the cost of materials and supplies, project-related travel expenses, etc. 

Since 2021, Strong Fellowship recipients have improved access to a variety of collections, including the [League of Women Voters of Moscow records](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv211561), the [Women in Natural Resources collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv702668), the [Palouse Science Fiction Association collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv334160), and the [Lyle J. Reed collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv425711) related to the Old Time Fiddle Festival.
