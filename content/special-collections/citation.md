## Do I need to cite materials I found in the archive?

Yes. Primary sources and other archival materials are still subject to the same intellectual property rights, copyright, and trademark laws in the United States. The best way to avoid plagiarism is to use your own words and cite all of your sources! 

## How do I cite archival sources?

If your professor or publisher does not require a specific citation style, here is a [general guide](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/citing).

Citations should lead your readers directly to the original sources you have consulted and should include as much identifying information as possible. Citations should include:

- author or creator's name
- title of the work or specific item
- date
- publication information
- collection title
- box and folder number, or photograph number
- repository (name of the archive that houses the materials)

Hereâ€™s an example from one of our [collections](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv119445/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&q=): 

"Three men and loaded gun rack inside tent," undated. Priest Lake Museum Association Photographs, photo #17-01-26. University of Idaho Library, Special Collections and Archives, Moscow, Idaho. 

## Do I need to obtain permission to publish materials from your collections?

Yes, you do need to obtain permission to publish materials from our collections, and we cannot always grant permission. When we accept materials, we agree to house them, but the original owner retains copyright and intellectual property of the materials. For this reason, we cannot grant or deny permission to publish or otherwise distribute materials if we do not hold the copyright to them. If the materials fall under the legal category of public domain, you may publish or distribute them freely.

Users are solely responsible for ensuring that they are observing Fair Use as defined in the United States Copyright Act.
