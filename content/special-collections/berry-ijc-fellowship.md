The Berry International Jazz Collections Fellowship funds one student each year to collaborate with the faculty and staff at the University of Idaho Library to increase the visibility and use of the [International Jazz Collections (IJC)](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/) through work on a specific project.
The University of Idaho Library invites students from any discipline at the University of Idaho to apply for the Berry International Jazz Collections Fellowship.

## 2020/21 Fellowship Project

The fellowship project for the 2020/2021 academic year is based on the Library's [Lionel Hampton Collection](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/hampton_collection/) and is titled "Exploring Hampton's Social Network." 
The 2020/2021 Fellow will work with faculty to conduct original research to identify dates, places, and individuals in historical photographs, and then use that information to create new features in our digital collections. 
These features may include geolocating photos, creating interactive timelines, and/or employing other digital humanities methods to allow users to engage with the Lionel Hampton Collection.

The fellowship begins in the fall semester and will conclude with an exhibition of the student's work at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival as part of the Library's International Jazz Collection exhibits. 
The fellow should plan to spend approximately 10-15 hours per week between October and February in order to accomplish the goals of the project.

This award includes a $4,000 student fellowship given as a stipend and up to $500 in research funds to help cover the cost of materials and supplies, project-related travel expenses, etc.

## How to Apply

Students must submit 1) a written application as outlined below, and 2) a letter of support from a U of I faculty member.
