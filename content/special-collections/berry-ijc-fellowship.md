### Call for Applications
The University of Idaho Library invites students from any discipline at the University of Idaho to apply for the Berry International Jazz Collections Fellowship. 
This program funds one student each year to collaborate with the faculty and staff at the University of Idaho Library to increase the visibility and use of the [International Jazz Collections (IJC)](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/) through work on a specific research project. 
The project may use one of the collections [highlighted below](#collections), or utilize an [IJC collection](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/) of the applicant's choosing.

The fellowship begins in the fall 2021 semester and will conclude with an exhibition of the student’s work at the 2022 Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival as part of the Library’s International Jazz Collection exhibits. 

In addition to the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival exhibition of the student's work, the project outputs may also take the form of a Library digital collection or multi-modal essay (see [Past Projects](#past) for examples).

The fellow should plan to spend approximately 10-15 hours per week between October and February in order to accomplish the goals of the project. 
This award includes a $4,000 student fellowship given as a stipend and up to $500 in research funds to help cover the cost of materials and supplies, project-related travel expenses, etc.
