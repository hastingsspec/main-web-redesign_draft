Any potential donation of historic materials should be discussed with the department's staff in advance of the gift. Donors are required to complete a Deed of Gift form. Having accurate and thorough documentation of donations is beneficial for our repository as well as for researchers. This form can be completed online or downloaded and filled out as a PDF.

## Monetary Support

Monetary support is not required when gifting archival materials. Financial contributions do enable timely processing and helps underwrite the costs of long-term high security storage. Such funds are used to organize, maintain, and care for our collections so that they may be preserved and made available for future generations.

Gift funds may be used to honor an individual, a family, a company, or an organization, and the Library will work with donors to employ appropriate means to publicly acknowledge donations. 
If interested in making a monetary gift to Special Collections and Archives, please contact Dulce Kersting-Lark, department Head, at <dulce@uidaho.edu> or call (208) 885-1309. To discuss setting up endowments or bequests, please contact Ben Hunter, Dean of University of Idaho Libraries, at <bhunter@uidaho.edu> or call (208) 885-5858. 
More information is also available on the [Giving page](/giving/).
