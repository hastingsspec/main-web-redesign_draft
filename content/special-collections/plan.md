The Special Collections Reading Room welcomes all researchers! Since archival materials are non-circulating (meaning, you cannot check them out like circulating library books), you can only view our materials in our Reading Room, located on the [first floor of the library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/maps.html). If you are unable to come to the Reading Room in person, please contact us to discuss options for digital reproductions of materials.

## Current Hours

Due to COVID-19, our Reading Room hours and policies have changed.

Access to the Reading Room will require visitors to adhere the following policies until further notice:

- **Face masks are required** in the Reading Room at all times. 
- Only two visitors are allowed in the Reading Room at a time. 
- Visitors are expected to observe established seating arrangements within the Reading Room. 

Appointment hours are between 9am and 4pm Monday through Friday.  

Please contact libspec@uidaho.edu or 208-885-0845 to make an appointment. 
We ask for at least two business days of notice so we may do any preparatory searching and retrieving in advance. 

*Note: Library staff reserve the right to close the Reading Room or make alternative accommodations for health and safety reasons even if an appointment has been made.*
