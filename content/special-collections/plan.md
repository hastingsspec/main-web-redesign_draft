The Special Collections Reading Room welcomes all researchers! Since archival materials are non-circulating (meaning, you cannot check them out like circulating library books), you can only view our materials in our Reading Room, located on the [first floor of the library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/maps.html). If you are unable to come to the Reading Room in person, please contact us to discuss options for digital reproductions of materials.
