If you are unable to come to the Reading Room in person, please [contact us](mailto:libspec@uidaho.edu) to discuss options for digital reproductions of materials.

Please contact libspec@uidaho.edu or (208) 885-0845 to make an appointment.

- Please be courteous and set cell phones and other sound devices to quiet mode.
- Please respect fellow researchers and be mindful of noise and space.
- Before leaving, straighten all papers and folders inside boxes. Return all materials to staff. As a security measure, the department reserves the right to inspect all research materials and personal articles.
- Please use outcards to preserve the existing order and arrangement of all unbound materials. Please use one box and one folder out at a time. Notify a staff member if material is found out of order.

### Equipment

- Laptops, notebooks, and pencils are allowed at research tables. Pens are not allowed.
- We provide two computers, two flatbed scanners, and digital camera stand for use by researchers (please check with staff before scanning or photographing any materials).
- Cell phones with cameras, digital cameras, and scanners are permitted with staff approval.

### Accident Prevention

- All food and beverages are prohibited.
- Materials must be handled with extreme care to ensure their preservation. Turn pages carefully, make no marks on the materials, rest no books or other objects on the face or surface of items used. Restrictions may be set to protect fragile or damaged materials.

### Reproductions

This does not include permission to publish, exhibit, broadcast or electronically disseminate the materials consulted by the researcher. Permission for these uses must be obtained by separate agreement and possible payment of fees with the department of Special Collections and Archives.
