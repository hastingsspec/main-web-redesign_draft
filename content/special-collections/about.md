Special Collections and Archives is a department within the University of Idaho Library that specializes in the acquisition, preservation, and use of archival research materials that document the history and culture of Idaho and the University of Idaho.

Our collections include, but are not limited to:

- Personal papers of individuals and families
- Business records (lumber, railroad, mining, etc.)
- Idaho state publications
- Papers of government officials, educators, authors, artists, etc.
- Organizational and association records (religious, fraternal, civic, environmental, non-profit, etc.)
- Book collections on local, historical, and literary topics
