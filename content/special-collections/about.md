- Personal papers and individuals and families
- Business records (lumber, railroad, mining, etc.)
- Idaho state publications
- Papers of government officials, educators, authors, artists, etc.
- Organizational and association records (religious, fraternal, civic, environmental, non-profit, etc.)
- Book collections on local, historical, and literary topics

# Policies 

### Material Donations
Please call (208) 885-0845 or email <libspec@uidaho.edu> to discuss any potential donations of archives, personal papers, photographs, and/or select publications. Collections that may be accepted include those relating to the history, culture and environment of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest, University history and memorabilia, and personal papers or memorabilia of jazz musicians and critics. 

### Monetary Support

Archival collections frequently need cash donations to enable timely processing and underwrite the costs of long-term high security storage. Such funds are used to organize, maintain, and care for our collections so that they may be preserved and made available for future generations.

Gift funds may be used to honor an individual, a family, a company, or an organization, and the Library will work with donors to employ appropriate means to publicly acknowledge donations. To discuss setting up endowments or bequests, please contact Ben Hunter, Dean of University of Idaho Library, at <bhunter@uidaho.edu> or (208) 885-5858. More information is also available on the [Giving](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/giving/) website.
