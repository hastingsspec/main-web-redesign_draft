### Do I need to make an appointment?

While appointments are not required, they are strongly encouraged. Letting us know in advance when you plan to come into the Reading Room and what you would like to view, allows us to have the requested materials ready. Additionally, some requests can be fulfilled digitally.

### Is everything available digitally?

While it is not possible to digitize everything due to the vast amount of materials, we are constantly working to digitize select collections and make them available online. To browse our digitized materials, check out our [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and [Idaho Harvester](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/) blog.
