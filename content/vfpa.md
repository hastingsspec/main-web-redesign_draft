*We want your photos!*
{:.h3}

The Vandal Family Photo Album serves two purposes: 
it provides U of I Alums with a great way to share photos and explore other Vandals' favorite memories from their time at U of I, and it provides the U of I Library with photos and stories that show what it means to be a Vandal.

We are collecting photos from your time as a student at U of I, and right now we're especially interested in photos taken during the 1960s.

## Contribute

Helping is easy!

- Step 1: Scan your photos at home (minimum 300 dpi), or have your photos scanned at any one of many local retailers including Costco, Walmart, or Walgreens.
- Step 2: Once you have your favorite photos scanned, upload them [using our online submission form](https://uidaho.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6g6KAE6dc7GxkuF)!

That's it! 
We'll compile photos as we get them into an easy-to-explore digital photo album that will continue to grow as we get new submissions.
