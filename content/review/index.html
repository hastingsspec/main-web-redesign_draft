<p>Due to a number of factors including recent base budget reductions for the main library, journal inflation, and changing use patterns, the Library is initiating a journal and database review process that will result in cancellations for a number of low-use journals and databases.</p>
 
<p>While the overall number of potential cancellations represents less than 1% of our total holdings, we take our responsibility to keep our users informed seriously. Therefore, we are listing all titles that are slated for potential cancellation and will be welcoming input from our university community through the end of April. While we can’t guarantee that every request to retain a journal or database will be honored, we will do our best to be responsive to the feedback that we receive.</p>

<p>Going forward, we plan to make this an annual process that is focused not on preventing an anticipated budget deficit (as this year’s project is), but instead to redirect money toward new subscriptions that meet current and emerging university needs. This new process will not result in sudden major shifts in availability and will instead ensure that library funds are being used effectively and strategically.</p>
 
<p>Additionally, the Library is investing in improvements for our interlibrary loan (ILL). These improvements, slated for fall of 2019, will include single sign-on for your ILL account, and potential improvements in delivery time for electronic articles. Our hope is that this will lessen any inconvenience that our review process causes.</p>
 
<p>The list of potential cancellations is available as a table on the <a href="{{ '/review/table.html' | relative_url }}">Journal and Database Review Items</a> page. If you do not see a title that the Library currently subscribes to on this list, it is not in danger of being cancelled this year.</p>
