<p>Thank you to all who participated in the U of I Libraryâ€™s 2019 Journal and Database Review Process. Individuals who submitted feedback and included contact information will be notified of final decisions.</p>

<p>We anticipate that this process will be repeated on an annual basis for the foreseeable future. This is due to a number of factors including base budget reductions for the main library, journal inflation, and changing use patterns. This process will allow the Library to maximize the impact of a finite collections budget by redirecting money toward new subscriptions that meet current and emerging university needs. The library will strive to make this process as open, inclusive, and transparent as possible so that we can continue to offer our users the best possible resources and services.</p>
