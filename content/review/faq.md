  <p>For this year’s project, we focused on resources that have a cost per use (total annual price divided by a three-year average of numbers of times used) of greater than $40. In other words, if a $1000/year journal was used 20 times, it would make it on the list due to a price per use of $50. A $200/year journal with 20 uses would have a price per use of $10, and would therefore not be on the list of potential cancellations.</p>

  <p>Journal and database subscriptions rise at a rate around 5-6% per year. Given that the majority of the library’s budget is devoted to resources of these kinds, this has a substantial impact every year. This is a problem that every academic library is dealing with right now. There have been discussions about the sustainability of this business model within the academic library community for many years; while new models of funding scholarly publishing are currently being pursued, we have not yet seen a significant change in our financial obligations.</p>

  <p>We are members of various library purchasing consortia and negotiate aggressively with publishers and content providers. However, in most cases there is only one source to license specific journals from, creating a monopoly for the providers.</p>
