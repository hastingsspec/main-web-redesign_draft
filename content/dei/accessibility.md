The University of Idaho Library strives to make all of its online content accessible to all users. We do accessibility audits as part of our regular design process, using Lighthouse and other accessibility and peformance audit services to assess our site on an ongoing manner. 

We are informed by the philosophy that accessibility is part of better useability. Any improvements we make to better structure and markup information are intended to positively impact access for all users, on all devices, and to enable preservation for future users. 

We develop our website and platforms using static web technologies (JAMStack, Jeykll, open APIs) and following the [lib-STATIC](https://lib-static.github.io/)  methodology. The simplicity of our web approach lends to fairly good accessibility, and the ability to quickly fix issues. 

Here are some accessibility resources relevant to library websites that we use as guides for our development:

-(ARL best practices)[https://accessibility.arl.org/standards-best-practices/]
-(Useability.gov)[https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html]
-(Accessibility developers guide)[https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/]
-(MDN webdocs Accessibility tools)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility]
