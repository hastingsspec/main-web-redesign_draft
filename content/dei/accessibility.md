The University of Idaho Library strives to make all of its online content accessible to all users. 
We carry out accessibility audits as part of our regular design process, using [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure) and other accessibility and performance audit services to assess our site in an ongoing manner. 

We are informed by the philosophy that accessibility is part of better useability. 
Any improvements we make to better structure and markup information are intended to positively impact access for all users, on all devices, and to enable preservation for future users. 

We develop our website and platforms using modern static web technologies (JAMStack, Jekyll, open APIs) and following the [lib-STATIC](https://lib-static.github.io/)  methodology. 
The simplicity of our web approach lends to good accessibility and the ability to quickly fix issues. 

Here are some accessibility resources relevant to library websites that we use as guides for our development:

- [ARL Web Accessibility Toolkit: Standards & Best Practices](https://accessibility.arl.org/standards-best-practices/)
- [Useability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html)
- [Accessibility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/)
- [MDN Webdocs Docs: Handling common accessibility problems](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility)
