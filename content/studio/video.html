    <h3>Video Recording in the Studio</h3>
    <p>The Studio is currently optimized with light sound paneling to record podcasts, short films, and interviews. A green screen and 3 lights are available at all times when you reserve the room.</p>
    <p><b>Be warned that there is a noticeable hum in the room, and the elevator and door adjacent to the room will be
        picked up by most microphone setups. </b></p>
    <p>See iZotope RX 6 software to deal with these issues.</p>

                  <p>We have many options available to record audio in the Studio. Already set up for easy use are two SM58
                    microphones, MPK Mini MIDI keyboard,&nbsp;AKAI Soundcraft mixing board with XLR and 1/4" input, and a
                    MOTU&nbsp;audio interface with 1/4" input. These options should suffice for podcasts, single track
                    recordings, simple MIDI input, and simple video voiceover.</p>
        
                  <p>When you check out the room, you will have the option to get a key for the locked cabinet containing more
                    microphones. If you do get this key, expect a longer wait time at the end of your reservation for us to
                    check inventory. Here's a quick list of what the&nbsp;cabinet contains for audio:</p>
        
                  <ul>
                    <li>Rode NT1A&nbsp;microphone&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>CAJ Isomax microphone (small pin-on microphone for video dialogue)&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>XLR cables</li>
                    <li>1/4" phone cables</li>
                  </ul>
        
                  <p>These options are best suited for audio professionals looking to multitrack. The room is not soundproofed,
                    so please do not expect isolation, recording booth audio recordings (although we do have software to help
                    with these issues).</p>
