    <h3>Recording in the Studio</h3>
    <p>The Studio is currently optimized with light sound paneling to record podcasts, short films, and interviews.
      Other audio recording is possible, but do not expect the same outcome as a recording booth or soundproofed room.
      Certain musical instruments are allowed as long as volumes are kept at an appropriate level. <b>No percussive
      instruments whatsoever.</b> There are 1/4" jacks in to easily record electric instruments. Training will be provided
      for those wanting to use electric instruments in the space.</p>
    <p><b>Be warned that there is a noticeable hum in the room, and the elevator and door adjacent to the room will be
        picked up by most microphone setups. See iZotope RX 6 software to deal with these issues.</b></p>
    <p>An easier option to deal with this room noise is to check out a TASCAM recorder, find a quieter place to record,
      then edit your work with The Studio audio software.</p>

          <p>We have many options available to record audio in the Studio. Already set up for easy use are two SM58
            microphones, MPK Mini MIDI keyboard,&nbsp;AKAI Soundcraft mixing board with XLR and 1/4" input, and a
            MOTU&nbsp;audio interface with 1/4" input. These options should suffice for podcasts, single track
            recordings, simple MIDI input, and simple video voiceover.</p>

          <p>When you check out the room, you will have the option to get a key for the locked cabinet containing more
            microphones. If you do get this key, expect a longer wait time at the end of your reservation for us to
            check inventory. Here's a quick list of what the&nbsp;cabinet contains for audio:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Rode NT1A&nbsp;microphone&nbsp;</li>
            <li>CAJ Isomax microphone (small pin-on microphone for video dialogue)&nbsp;</li>
            <li>XLR cables</li>
            <li>1/4" phone cables</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These options are best suited for audio professionals looking to multitrack. The room is not soundproofed,
            so please do not expect isolation, recording booth audio recordings (although we do have software to help
            with these issues).</p>

          <p>Currently, we have a TASCAM portable microphone recorder in a kit with a SHURE SM57 microphone. This kit comes with a microphone stand, 4 GB microSD card, and a USB cable for easy transfer. There are two kits available, each with a loan period of 24 hours.</p>
            <p>To check out this equipment, head to circulation desk. We have a technology loan agreement form you will have to fill out, so
            please be patient and expect a slight wait time. You will receive a copy of this loan agreement detailing
            fines and fees for damaged or lost equipment.</p>
